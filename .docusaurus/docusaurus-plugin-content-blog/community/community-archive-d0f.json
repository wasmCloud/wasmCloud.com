More research and hopefully comments from those developers needed\n  - Currently, the .NET template `wasm-browser` for Blazor builds the module in a way that it requires a JavaScript runtime with proprietary functions, e.g. running in a browser and not on the server-side. It can sort-of work with a NodeJS runtime.\n- Upcoming stream on Rust libraries and the wash-lib migration, to be posted to the wasmCloud YouTube\n  - Planning to separate out different features into optional installable portions, eventually this will result in a WASI-supported wash distribution\n  - With WASI preview 2, the ability to set up Unix-style command line interfaces is proposed in a PR for WASI: https://github.com/Kylebrown9/component-model/blob/typed-main/design/mvp/CLIEmbedding.md\n- A few companies and projects have come up with their own way to access keyvalue stores, send messages, etc. We want to be able to collaborate on common interfaces so that WebAssembly modules can easily plug into different projects and be interchangeable. We don't want Wasm standards to divide based on different common interfaces.\n  - Bailey pitched a few options for migration models, with the general consensus leaning towards **Option B**. Reasoning: People are okay with breaking changes _occasionally_ but not all the time, so a simple migration path with a potential change is preferred.\n    - Option A for aggressive. We can strive for early and perhaps frequent iteration with major revs as the standard evolves. One major for going from what we have directly to wit. Another to adopt the standards we collaborating on in the w3c.\n    - Option B for barely major. One major for wit (as close to 1:1 as we have today with smithy). We put out alphas as the standard evolves and no major rev until the standard is fully accepted (there are 4 phases, so we’re talking phase 4)\n    - Option C, careful majors. Skip the first 1:1 major rev, and select a set of standards that have mostly early acceptance, e.g. phase 2. This could add 2 weeks. We could start with alpha only before this happens\n  - There will still be wasmCloud-specific `wit` files for things that are not common to many many applications out there, but we'll be adopting each standardized interface.\n  - wasmCloud is breaking this into chunks\n    - Moving the underlying host to `wasmtime`, a mature WebAssembly engine that supports components now\n    - Then moving to interfaces and bringing in standards\n\n### Recording\n\nRecording is being uploaded to YouTube and will be displayed promptly"

Docusaurus supports internationalization, nice styles by default, document versioning, and more, hence the choice for documentation.\n\n- Short demo of `wash down` shutting down a wasmCloud host and NATS servers that are launched with wash up. This won’t affect externally running NATS servers (e.g. via systemd services.)\n\n  - Small question around the ordering: The ordering of wasmcloud shutdown then NATS is important so that the wasmCloud host has time to send any remaining messages, tell capability providers to shutdown, and then send the final “host_stopped” event so that any other listening entities can react to the host stopping.\n\n- As we consider project templates, one thing that we noticed is that our actions in the project templates work great for single repositories but not for monorepos. We briefly explored some alternatives and methods in the call, ultimately landing on some things we can iterate on and try to manage actor secrets.\n\n- Makefiles for projects will soon be deprecated, and then in a later minor version of wash (at least `0.15.0`+) they will be removed in favor of `wash build`. This is nice as these Makefiles already only sort-of work for Windows workflows\n\n- Brought up the [Kelsey Hightower & Scott Johnston fireside chat on WebAssembly](https://cosmonic.com/blog/webassembly-with-kelsey-hightower-and-docker-ceo-scott-johnston-kubecon-na-2022)\n\n### Recording\n\nRecording is being uploaded to YouTube and will be displayed promptly"
