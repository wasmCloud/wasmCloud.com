![wasmCloud Innovation Day](./images/innovation-day.jpg)

**Date**: 18th September, 2024  
**Time**: 10am-6pm Eastern  
**Location**: Virtual, [RSVP](https://wasmcloud.com/innovation-day)!

Since the release of WASI 0.2 and the WebAssembly (Wasm) Component Model in January, we’ve focused on making wasmCloud the best place for engineering teams to bring Wasm to their own architectures. wasmCloud 1.0 brought the component model to life in the world’s largest organizations—helping to reduce the cost and complexity of Kubernetes, and making it possible thrive at the edge. Now with a bevy of new features in 1.1 (1.2 and 1.3 releasing soon), wasmCloud is cementing its reputation as the enterprise-ready, Wasm-native orchestration platform of choice.

We wanted to get the open source community together to dive into the latest innovation, hear the experiences of wasmCloud users and customers, and celebrate the work of our maintainers and community contributors. That’s why we created **wasmCloud Innovation Day**, taking place on the 18th September from 10am ‘til 6pm ET.

Whether you’re already using Wasm or a complete newbie, this one-day virtual event is the ideal immersion in all things WebAssembly and wasmCloud. We’ll explore wasmCloud’s technical architecture, fresh and growing feature set and, most importantly, hear how companies in a host of industries are working with this popular open source CNCF project.

Here’s what to expect—check out the full agenda below and [**register now**](https://wasmcloud.com/innovation-day)!

**wasmCloud in Industry:** Hear how engineers from the world’s largest organizations are using wasmCloud in real-world use cases…stay tuned for details.

**Technical Deep Dive:** wasmCloud has been transformed with WASI 0.2 and wasmCloud 1.1 is full of features designed to make building with components a joy. From secrets support to creating your own custom capabilities, we’ll take a deeper look at what’s new, and how to get the most out of 1.1.

**Community Workshop and Hangout:** Join us in Gather space to build your own Wasm application and hang with industry leaders, our valued open source contributors and wasmCloud users.
