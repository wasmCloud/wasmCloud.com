This year, wasmCloud is getting into the spooky spirit by participating in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)! Our primary development repositories all feature the `hacktoberfest` topic. Whether youâ€™re interested in your first open source contribution, learning Rust for the first time, getting involved with a WebAssembly project or seasoned in all of the above, youâ€™re invited to participate!

## Whatâ€™s Hacktoberfest?

Itâ€™s difficult to describe the event better than DigitalOcean does on the website itself, so weâ€™ll just go with that description!

> Hacktoberfest is DigitalOceanâ€™s annual event that encourages people to contribute to open source throughout October. Much of modern tech infrastructureâ€”including some of DigitalOceanâ€™s own productsâ€”relies on open-source projects built and maintained by passionate people who often donâ€™t have the staff or budgets to do much more than keep the project alive. Hacktoberfest is all about giving back to those projects, sharpening skills, and celebrating all things open source, especially the people that make open source so special.

## How do I complete Hacktoberfest?

If you can get 4 pull requests merged with the `hacktoberfest` label or in `hacktoberfest` discussion marked repositories, you completed Hacktoberfest! Completing the event gets you a shiny badge that you can show off on GitHub/GitLab, and DigitalOcean will plant a tree on your behalf.

## Participating wasmCloud Repositories

Weâ€™ve added our [wadm](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wadm), [wash](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash), [wasmCloud](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud), and [examples](https://github.com/wasmCloud/examples) repositories to the `hacktoberfest` discussion. Additionally, weâ€™ve gone through our issues list and attached the `hacktoberfest` label to a couple of issues that we feel are particularly suited to new open source contributors. You can also take a look at any issues that have the `good-first-issue` label, as those are great starting points too!

If you find an issue that youâ€™d like to complete and itâ€™s not marked with an applicable label or in a repository with the right discussion topic, let us know! When you open a pull request just add a note that youâ€™re here from Hacktoberfest and weâ€™ll add the issue to the PR so it will still count towards your total of four.

## Join the Community!

If you're looking at tackling an issue, please come join us in ourÂ [Community Slack](https://slack.wasmcloud.com/)Â to take part in the conversation, or join our community meetingsÂ [every Wednesday at 1pm](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_6cm5hud8evuns4pe5ggu3h9qrs@group.calendar.google.com). wasmCloud maintainers and community members alike enjoy talking about solving issues, answering questions and just generally coming together with enthusiasm for Rust and WebAssembly. Weâ€™d love to have you!
