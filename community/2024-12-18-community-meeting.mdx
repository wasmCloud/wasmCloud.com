### DEMO: Brooks demos a new example of a simple banking app

- Brooks has been working on a banking application - a microservice written in go for wasmCloud that has a UI and keeps track of transactions over time.
- This application perfectly demonstrates how to bundle authentication, secrets, frontend, Go app, golang OAuth library - compiled into a component and running in wasmCloud.
- We have this distilled into a repo and Brooks gives a detailed demo of this in action. As always, it's difficult to describe the goodness of the demo and so please check out the recording below!
- Brooks shows how easy it is to deposit and transfer out of the app and show balance, and retrospective balance tracking.
- All stored in the NATS KV bucket - automatically launched with wash dev. 
- This is all served by one component with notable features; embedding the static assets for the UI, using a cool HTTP router library for OAuth flow and logging in, and a couple flows for IDs and transactions.
- React app on the frontend. 
- User info is integrated from github with secure GitHub token - cookie created with user info - which is how you stay logged in.
- UI is super nice - we'll share the example in the repo soon!

### Discussions

- **[Masoud (@ossfellow)](https://github.com/ossfellow)**: What happens if I distribute this component to different environments?
  - **[Brooks (@brooksmtownsend)](https://github.com/brooksmtownsend)**: you would have the same experience. When you send a request, it is handled by 3 different components - doesn't matter which one as you're served on the individual request. If you have the concept of a 'session' you may need to be careful which component you're targeting.
- **Tyler**: How do I authorise requests in an edge-facing component and pass the user context/auth along? Pre-authorise?
  - **[Brooks (@brooksmtownsend)](https://github.com/brooksmtownsend)**: Tokenization is done up-front, no need to re-auth but rigorous approach would be to keep around the OAuth token as a cookie - sent to the backend on request throughout the user journey.

Tune in to the recording to hear the wider Q&A and ensuing discussion.

### One last check in of the [Q4 roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7/views/12)

- There has been some significant progress in the roadmap. 
- Most PRs have been commenced with many having been closed out for the year.
- There are a couple of open PRs ready for collaboration but we have made excellent progress this quarter.
- Take a look in the [repo](to get involved and see all open PRs), and check out the recording below for Brook's summary of progress.
- We have started thinking about the [Q1 2025 roadmap](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/discussions/3813), check out the comments and questions currently in discussion as we set the high level initiatives for the project.
