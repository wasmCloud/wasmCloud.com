### Agenda
- DEMO: wasmCloud devcontainers 
- Upcoming conference overview

{/* truncate */}

### Meeting Notes
- General note: The wasmCloud community members that run the call are all at an offsite in Atlanta so this call featured some fun AV experimentation
- DEMO
  - We have open PRs into `wash` and `wasmcloud-otp` with a devcontainer for developing both of these projects. We aren't quite there to release the built container, but both of these are ready for you to try with `devcontainer open`!
  - We're looking for proper devcontainer use cases and providing a good experience for developers that use codespaces or just devcontainers to develop in open source
  - Additionally, we are also looking into running our examples in a devcontainer so that users could easily go from looking at the repo to a fully featured example environment
- Conferences
  - Kevin will be speaking at KubeCon EU 2023! "Distributed Event Sourcing with wasmCloud" https://kccnceu2023.sched.com/event/1Hycy/distributed-event-sourcing-with-wasmcloud-kevin-hoffman-cosmonic
  - Bailey Hayes and Dan Chiarlone will be speaking at wasm.io on wasi-cloud: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7cSjIp7vRg
  - Bailey and Taylor will be running a "wasmCloud crash course with Cosmonic" at wasm.io (link forthcoming)
- General ranting
  - We talked about devcontainers, nix, guix, haskell, lisp, and more!
  - We also had two new community members, Victor and Roman, introduce themselves
