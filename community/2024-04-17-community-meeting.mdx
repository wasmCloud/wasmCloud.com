### Meeting Notes

* Brooks reviewed the wasmCloud 1.0 roadmap&mdash;all items are complete! 

* Bugs and minor issues are all tackled. So live on the call, Brooks bumped wash and wasmCloud to 1.0. :fireworks:

* After celebrating the 1.0 release, Brooks showed [liamwh](https://github.com/liamwh)'s recent contribution to the wasmCloud docs, adding his neovim extension for WIT syntax highlighting to the [Useful WebAssembly Tools](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/1.0/ecosystem/useful-webassembly-tools/) page. 

* Brooks also pointed out Bailey's [RFC for implementing a Postgres interface](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/1914). Bailey explained the thinking behind the proposal, including taking a declarative approach (rather than using sockets in a POSIX-style approach) and allowing developers to use the implementation-specific syntax required in the world of SQL databases.

* In the future, it'll be great to think about how to socialize third-party interfaces and providers! Bailey noted that providers are essentially wasmCloud host plug-ins, so it's easy for people to build their own.
