## Meeting Notes

### DEMO: What's new in 0.82?

- We have some lovely new features coming in 0.82. Shout out to Eric Gregory for [his blog](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/wasmcloud-0.82-wasi-p2-is-here) that shares all the detail.
- Full and stable support for WASI 0.2 is here and ready for 1.0. All the APIs in WASI 0.2 are pinned in this version.
- This brings a certain level of stability as with 0.2 we have the opportunity to build with future standards—adapting APIs from one version to the next.
- Stable base for building with components.
- Quality of life developments- bug fixes and improvements. Lots of detail in the blog around what's changing and reviewing where we are on the road to wasmCloud 1.0.
- Call out: 0.82 is the release where using was modules in the wasmbus rpc protocol becomes officially deprecated. It still works but we're encouraging folks to start with components — especially as they can do it in multiple languages. Python, Typescript, Rust, TinyGo, JS. In fact, any language that supports components.
- Take a look at the [Quickstart](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/tour/hello-world) which has been updated with the latest component tooling - there are no wasmCloud dependencies.
- Take a look at the recording for a couple of demos on specific enhancements to the user experience.
- Thanks to all of you that are contributing, commenting and building!

### IMPORTANT: Calling all community members; please try 0.82 for yourselves. We'd love your feedback

### DISCUSSION: Roadmap check-in

- Huge amount of progress in the wRPC project thanks to Roman and Victor.
- Swarming on the wasmCloud host right now.
- We are planning on making changes to wasmCloud host and testing suite.
- If you are working on a feature in wasmCloud and are concerned we might cause issues by modifying, please reach out.
- There is more in progress than we have in the backlog!
- Metrics and defining interfaces are the latest tasks to be complete.
- wRPC is the last major feature:
  - Pinning our WITS to 1.0
  - Adding a couple of events
- If you're keen to contribute, the [drop deprecated wasmbus lattice](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/1104) first issue is a really good one to contribute to.

### COMMUNITY DISCUSSION AND Q&A

- Colin: Fuzzing (send random bits and see if it creates fatal errors).
  - Fuzzing in rust unless you want to stand up the entire wasmCoud host every time, it's hard to call a specific function without standing everything up.
  - Limitations of macros on top of macros.
  - Mock All - most commonly used.
  - Anyone have any familiarity mocking/fuzzing in Rust?
- Bailey: The layer you're fuzzing is important, and the point at which you choose to report bugs.
- Check out the recording for the full discussion.
