## Meeting Notes

### wadm progress report

- wadm is progressing very nicely, with a ton of work going in over the past few weeks into the Rust rewrite + restructure
- The Actor spread scaler is fully implemented
- The ability for users to deploy and undeploy manifests is fully implemented
- Essentially, what's left is managing providers, link definitions, some e2e testing, and integration with `wash`

### Golang merging wasip1

- Exciting news as Golang merges wasip1 support, so you can build WASI modules with `GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build`, coming in Go 1.21
- The Wasm support differs slightly from TinyGo but with go 1.22 the support will be the same
- We'll be closely watching this develop as they formalize the way you import and export functions to see if we can use Go for wasmCloud actors
