## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### DEMO: A tour through the wasmcloud-component crate

- As always, it's difficult to express the goodness of this demo and so please check out the recording below.
- At wasmCloud Innovation Day, Lucas gave some examples of the component SDK for Go. We've been working on a lightweight version for Rust.
- This is newly published on crates.io and it's ready for you to import into a component project.
- Top-level macros - to proxy to wasi-logging for standard logging levels - debug error info etc. Use like you would idiomatic Rust.
- Additional structs and implementations for standard library crates and a couple of helper options: wasi-io, including pollable requests - useful for making mini http requests.
- Corresponds to how wit-bindgen generates types. The goal is you will be able to bring in the wasmCloud component crate and use that in a component application. Nicer experience working in Rust.
- wit-bindgen interface generation at crate level. Pattern emerging with WebAssembly crates in Rust.
- Again, check out the recording for Brooks's full demo.

### DISCUSSION: How to become a contributor to wasmCloud

- If you're wondering how to become a contributor, we recommend you visit the [wasmCloud repo](https://github.com/wasmCloud/) and take a look at the good first issues available for contribution.
- There are a ton of ways to get involved, regardless of the language you prefer to work in.
- [wasmCloud-contrib](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud-contrib) is also a wonderful place to see how others in the community are contributing to the wasmCloud project.

### DISCUSSION: Q4 roadmap

- A quick note to let everyone know we are coming up to the end of the quarter and we'll begin to plan for Q4 in the next fortnight.
- Check in on where we are with the current roadmap [here](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/roadmap/).
- wasmCloud is a 100% community-led project and so your role in setting the path forward is crucial. Join the wasmCloud Weekly Community meeting every Wednesday to have your say!

### Catch upâ€¦
