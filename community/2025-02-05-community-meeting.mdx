## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### Discussion: Workload identity RFC

* Joonas introduces background on an RFC for workload identity.
  - Infrastructure-agnostic.
  - Standards-based: interoperable across platforms.
  - Cryptographically verifiable. 
  - To the extent possible, fully automated. Workloads should only have to request identity for it to be available to them. 
* Use-cases: 
  - Securing NATS connectivity.
  - Dynamic, secret-less OCI artifact pulls.
  - Secret-less access to third party resources.
  - Mutual authN for host <-> provider communication.
  - Establishing trust across clusters.
* Implementation in three steps:
  - Host
  - Providers
  - Components
* What's next?
  - RCF/Proposal
  - POC demonstration of host integration
  - Tracking issue + work items
* **Question**: Would this be mandatory or optional?
  - Answer: The goal is definitely to make this optional.

### Discussion: `wash` pluginification RFC introduction

* Taylor introduces background on an RFC for plugin-ifying `wash`
* The RFC is available on GitHub: https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/4059
* "This enables more flexibility for things like auth providers and custom extensions for those running wasmCloud in production."
* This would replace current plugin model.
* **Question**: Current plugin model limits ability to use multi-tier subcommand. Would the new model be able to get around this limitation?
  - Answer: Yes, this should add increased flexibility to do all of the things you would expect.
* **Question**: What would our recommendations to contributors be if they wanted to add a feature to `wash`?
  - Answer: If this goes through, my thought would be that we recommend contributors implement the feature as a plugin.
