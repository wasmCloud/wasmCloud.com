## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### DEMO: Streaming with Blobby

- As always, it's difficult to express the goodness of Brooks's demo in notes and so please check out the recording below!
- Affectionately referred to as Little Blobby Tables in the wasmCloud ecosystem, this is a implementation of a file system using `wasi-http` and 'wasi-blobstore' standand interfaces. Essentially, this is an example of a reusable component that can be deployed with any http or blobstore to generate a file system.
- Historically, we have used a system of blocking reads and writes - we have been working on the `wasi-blobstore` implemetation in wasmCloud, fixed a couple of bugs and improved the way streaming works over wRPC.
- This is a perfect example of streaming data from 2 different interfaces and how nice it is when you can provide implementations with a standard language library. Also a great examples of how great it feels to work with these WASI constructs.
- WASI crate being used directly in pretty much all our Rust examples, with a huge amount of work happening in the Go community.
- In wasmCloud 0.1.2 we'll have the ability to strean data with WASI - more on that soon.
- Liam: this opens up a whole host of new possibilities. For example, we could now use stremaing algorithms for analysing the data. E.g. calculate shot 1 for each streaming file.
- Follow along with the demo and a much broader discussion in the recording!

Roman's Resources:
- Examples of resources in Rust with wRPC (what one would do on the provider side):
  - [wasi keyvalue NATS server](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wrpc/tree/main/examples/rust/wasi-keyvalue-nats-server)
  - [wasi keyvalue NATS client](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wrpc/tree/main/examples/rust/wasi-keyvalue-nats-client)
  - [Rust complex component server](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wrpc/tree/main/examples/rust/complex-component-server)
  - [Rust complex component client](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wrpc/tree/main/examples/rust/complex-component-client)

### DISCUSSION: [wasmCloud Innovation Day](https://wasmcloud.com/innovation-day)

- We've written a handy blog with all the details on what to expect at the [wasmCloud Innovation Day](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/2024-08-19-join-us-for-wasmcloud-innovation-day). 
- This is the first time we're holding a full day devoted to wasmCloud - technology, use cases, customers, community contributors and maintainers. And couldn't be more excited!
- The event will take place on the 18th September, 8am-6pm - full agenda can be found on the blog and [registration page](https://wasmcloud.com/innovation-day) - please share this with your friends, colleagues and anyone else you think might enjoy this deep dive into all things wasmCloud.
- As always, the highlight of any event is hearing what engineers are doing with wasmCloud - we have some fantastic user and customer demos planned which we'll announce in the coming days.
- As our community, you are an important part of this event and so please come along - as well as technical presentations and discussions, we have an afternoon hangout planned where we'll get to meet and greet new community members.
- We'll also have industry leaders from the Bytecode Alliance dropping in to say hi! [Register today!](https://wasmcloud.com/innovation-day)

## Weekly highlights

### Issue of the Week

- [[FEATURE] move wasmcloud.toml to a different directory for a tinygo component](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/2757)
  - Addition to wash library and wash CLI - there is already support in Rust where you can put the wasmCloud toml in a different diretory to where you're building the component,
  - For tinygo this doesn't work - we expect for that - but this feature will allow you to put this piee of metadata in a different file to improve the experience for TinyGo.
  - Being able to put metadata into a build folder should be super useful.
  - This is a great first issue to get started!

### Documentation of the Week

- [wash-cli autogenerated documentation](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/cli/)
  - One of the best updates we've seedn in a while - check it out!
  - We noticed the command line docs we had for wash a were outdated. Keeping ahead of all our changes was a challege.
  - Now we can autogenerate updates for each command, which will ensure all minor release are captured and adopted across the entire ecosystem (e.g. adding and removing command line flags).
  - Uses clap markdown, the implemnentation is not yet merged but will be soon!

## Community Updates

- wasmCloud 1.2 - we have some nice new updates and are cutting a release as we speak. Many improvements and 10 individual contributors means we're almost ready to release. Stay tuned for more details!

### Tune in…

{/* Add any upcoming events/streams/etc */}

- This week it's all about [wasmCloud Innovation Day](https://wasmcloud.com/innovation-day) - please sign up and share with your network! Thank you!

### Catch up…

- If you didn't see it, the [Cloud Native Live stream](https://youtu.be/B1Q_Xx5i6Ek) with Adobe's Colin Murphy and Akamai's Doug Rodrigues was truly outstanding. In this session, these two huge organizations collaborate to bring Wasm components to more clouds, servers, and edges than ever before. Watch to hear them discuss the relative benefits of containers versus components, and see wasmCloud running in multiple clouds and edges. Thanks to Colin and Doug for taking the time to speak to Brooks and Whitney!
