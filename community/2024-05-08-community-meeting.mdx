### Meeting Notes

**DEMO: wit-RPC Go implementation**
- It’s exciting to be able to talk about our Go implementations so we have a couple of demos to show in this week’s community meeting.
- First up, Roman demonstrates his [wit-RPC Go implementation](https://github.com/wrpc/wrpc/tree/main/examples/go).
- RPC is designed to be components-native. This is another reference implementation of the way wRPC does component model value encoding.
- Tl;dr: the value encoding proposal is PR-ed upstream and is implemented in multiple languages. What this means is the possible mix of multi-language tooling is endless.
- Notably, this has huge potential to interact with things outside the Wasm ecosystem. A real bridge to the future.
- wit-bindgen over RPC, with support for Go: Roman takes us through a simple hello world package with Go in his demo. It’s very difficult to do that justice here and so we really recommend watching the demo below.
- We can now run and maintain applications, built with components written in Go, in a distributed way with wRPC. This is a major step forward Gophers looking for ways to run and maintain the same application in a mixture of locations.
- [Some fresh innovation in the wRPC repo](https://github.com/wrpc/wrpc) from Roman; wRPC key-value NATS binary - being able to invoke functions over the lattice like wasi:keyvalue/store.get.

**DEMO: wasmCloud Golang provider SDK**
- Next up, Brooks shows a refreshed Go provider SDK for wasmCloud, based on Roman’s wRPC example.
- We do have an early Go provider SDK in the wasmCloud repo [provider-sdk-go](https://github.com/wasmCloud/provider-sdk-go/pull/9). This early version includes the logic to connect to NATS, control instantiation and an RPC layer (wasmbus RPC, pre 1.0 protocol).
- Now we have Roman’s new wRPC Go provider, we wanted to update this early SDK. Thanks to Jordan and others for giving us a solid foundation to build on. Take a look at the recording for the details and demo.
- It didn’t take much to convert Roman’s work to apply to wasmCloud: lattice name + provider ID in wasmCloud. Create new capability provider using wasmCloud provider SDK and apply wRPC provider prefix.
- Provider SDK handles all link location logic including health check requests and responses.
- This was a great exercise in hot-swapping providers.
- We can combine the RPC layer of the wRPC implementation and the logic to handle links to the NATS provider SDK, out of the box.
- Next, we would like to bring the wRPC library as a dependency of the SDK which will smooth the developer experience.
- We’ll focus on getting more examples into the wasmCloud monorepo in the Golang directory; more to come soon.

**DISCUSSION: [Q2 Roadmap Review](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7/views/10)**
- Thank you to all the community for your contributions to the roadmap discussion, and the suggestions seen since. Our [Q2 high level goals](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7/views/10) are updated and ready to view.
- Several notable new RFCs in the plan which are priorities for the next season.
- New documentation, new feature and improvement buckets can be [viewed in Github](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7).
- As community members looking to contribute, scan the good first issues as the starting point.

**DISCUSSION: cargo smart-release in wasmCloud/wasmCloud**
- In the wasmCloud repo we have many different crates with interdependencies.
- The hard part is releasing new versions of wash. Customarily, we work through the interdependencies individually.
- We’ve created a way to better (more quickly) manage patches and adjustments. It this tells us what dependencies need to bump, major or minor etc.
- Essentially, this creates a git tab and released in the right priority order. This has solved many of the update issues inherent in releasing new versions of wash.

**DEMO: Lachlan: New Lattice Client**
- A special, unscheduled demo on the new version of the washboard running from the new lattice client which mirrors functionality from wash.
- Lattice client has been rewritten so we have a way to do almost everything wash can do but through a JS library.
- Obtain, list and stop hosts - all the standard things you would do through wash are now avail on our new lattice client. Planning for release shortly.

**Where we’ll be…**

**May 10th:** Bailey will join [Dan Lorenc at Chainguard](https://www.linkedin.com/events/chainguardxcosmonic-wasmcloud-d7191086372173086720/about/) to discuss all things Wasm, Kubernetes, distroless compute models and more. With RSA happening this week all eyes are on security: this should be a good one.

**May 14th:** Taylor will be at [SWCon in Colorado](https://www.sw2con.com/#agenda) talking all things Wasm and how it’s transforming Kubernetes estates and complex compute architectures. His talk: ‘Why Worry About WASM?’ takes place at 2pm in Breakout 3 (Wasm and Severless track).

**Listen in…**

- The CNCF and Bytecode Alliance [came together on CNCF Cloud Native Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Nv51foQ1mQ) for an interesting discussion on WASI 0.2 the Component Model..and the role of the BA in driving forward Wasm standards and tooling.
- Cloud Native Wasm Day [recordings](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2MQteKoXxICTWiUdZYEw6RI&feature=shared) are available! Particular highlights are presentations from our community users MachineMetrics and Orange.
- Bailey joined Matt Butcher and industry analyst Dustin Kirkland on theCube (SiliconAngle) during KubeCon + CloudNativeCon to talk all things WebAssembly, [take a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU4TVukPs8g).
- Check out the [Arm Developer Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDTHXGuqXAI) where Bailey and Liam discussed the intersection of Wasm and GPU technologies.
- Cosmonic CTO Bailey Hayes met Chris Matteson (Fermyon) and Oscar Spencer (F5 NGINX) on the panel at the [latest Kubernetes meetup in New York](https://www.meetup.com/new-york-kubernetes-meetup/events/297886914/). They explored the Wasm what’s, why’s, standards and considerations when adoption. [The recording is live!](https://youtu.be/ThcQNR-aVvI)
- Listen in to the last [WasmEdge community meeting](https://youtu.be/ttiE7g2Ojuk) where Bailey Hayes talks all things WASI 0.2 and we hear from the students of the University of Tokyo on some cool new projects.
- Bailey was a guest on a recent [Rancher Live podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPdzvL59tIA) with Divya Mohan. Tune in for a deep dive into WASI 0.2!
