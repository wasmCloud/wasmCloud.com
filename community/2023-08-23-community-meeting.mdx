### Meeting Notes

- **New Community Member - Dave Tessman ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Dave!**
- **Discussion - wadm 0.5.0 official release, wash 0.20.0 coming soon**
  - Many alphas for wadm means lots of testing and lots of new features: manifest status, manifest validation, multitenant prefixes.
  - What is Wadm? Tool to assist with deploying applications in a declarative manner.
  - Demo - wadm 0.5.0 manifest validation.
  - validation built on top of OAM spec.
  - define components as custom types.
  - specify links values and spreadscaler conditions with custom traits on components.
  - The Demo:
    - valid demo: kvcounter app should access redis and use http server.
    - invalid dupe actor: duplicate actor with same image ref. Prefer not to run multiple components, use spread to control distribution.
    - invalid link manifest: two versions of the same link results in a validation error because they provide conflicting values.
    - invalid dupe provider: two components with the same provider component names, prefer spread scaler.
    - invalid duplicate link name: two providers with the same contract and link name, links can be used to configure providers.
- **Discussion - Roadmap**
  - Deamonscaler: adds ability to scale a component (actor/provider) to run X copies on every host that matches the label spec.
  - WASI Preview 2 components is in progress.
  - witify - changing interfaces to use wit IDL - only a few issues to complete.
  - OTP/Rust Host feature parity - more closed than open, lots and lots of progress (s/o to Roman and Connor and Victor).
