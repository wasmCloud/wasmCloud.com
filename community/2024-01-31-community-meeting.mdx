## Meeting Notes

Note: check out our new website! Thank you so much [Nik](https://github.com/boomskats) for all the work on [wasmCloud.com](http://wasmCloud.com) - we're stoked.

### DEMO: Stuart Harris and Viktor Charypar demo wasmCloud running composed Wasm components

- As usual, notes can only add so much when it comes to demos and so please check out the recording for Stuart and Viktor's fantastic demo.
- The aim here was to carry out PoC to do a side-by-side _comparison_ (including benchmarking) of what Wasm-based platforms could achieve versus other cloud platforms, such as K8s and friends. Viktor and Stuart have been playing with Wasm compositions ever since.
- The team wanted to do a PoC that runs the typical projects that a bank might choose, versus the same projects. However, instead of Java Spring Boot, we use Rust and, instead of K8s, we use wasmCloud.
- We also wanted to show the portability of this and how sustainable Wasm might be from a resource consumption, cost to maintain point of view. Rust Foundation and Open UK are both interested in this from a sustainability angle. There are a number of organizations interested in this PoC, which is exciting.
- Viktor takes us through the background, rationale and how they are running the comparison. The demo shows it is possible to work in the same way in components, and create efficiencies as a result.
- We'll keep the community posted on the progress of this project.
- There was a wider discussion on wRPC - check out the [early modeling](https://github.com/rvolosatovs/wrpc/tree/main) Roman has been working on.

### DEMO: WASI 0.2.0, what to expect and what it means for wamCloud

- You can view the [README in WASI repo](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/preview2/README.md).
- As most of you know, the release of WASI 0.2 (or .2) was voted ahead last week! Formal congratulations to the entire community - W3C Wasm Community and everyone in the Bytecode Alliance that worked tirelessly to get .2 over the line.
- We put a [small blog together to give a sense of why this is important](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/wasi-preview-2-officially-launches).
- The interfaces that are part of the proposal - io, clocks, random, sockets and wasi:http - will be supported in wasmCloud 1.0.
- This provides a standard common template for building and running components in wasmCloud - and in other places that support these common interfaces. A universal template for building with components.
- Library implementers can now start to work on their WASI target to compile down their library into the primitives that .2 provides.

### UPDATE: Tour of changes to our quickstart guides

- We have updated our [quickstart guide](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/tour/hello-world) to support a ton of new languages including Python, Typescript, Go and Rust.
- Thanks to the [Bytecode Alliance](https://bytecodealliance.org/) for the [componentize-py project](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-py) (and others) are doing that makes this possible.

### DISCUSSION: Roadmap and wRPC RFP

- A ton of changes have been made. [Check out the roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7/views/8) to see progress.
- We're particularly excited about the work that we're doing on WIT interfaces. One step closer to supporting all the goodness that came with WASI .2.
- wRPC is one of the largest pieces of work in the run up to wasmCloud 1.0. Quite a few new elements to finalize.
- For example, links will be unidirectional—'link this component's handler so the http server can connect'.
- We will also include WASI interfaces on links. whether standard or custom-built. This removes the mismatch between wasmCloud contracts and WASI interfaces.
- The ultimate aim: when you run a component in wasmCloud it feels like you're composing them dynamically over the NATS network.
- Take a look at the recording for more details on the roadmap.

## Community Updates

### Where we'll be…

Check out the [Arm Developer Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDTHXGuqXAI) where Bailey and Liam discussed the intersection of Wasm and GPU technologies.

Cosmonic CTO Bailey Hayes met Chris Matteson (Fermyon) and Oscar Spencer (F5 NGINX) on the panel at the [latest Kubernetes meetup in New York](https://www.meetup.com/new-york-kubernetes-meetup/events/297886914/). They explored the Wasm what's, why's, standards and considerations when adoption. [The recording is live!](https://youtu.be/ThcQNR-aVvI)

Check in on the latest Bytecode Alliance Community Stream on YouTube. Following the launch of WASI .2, this is a great opportunity to learn more about how these new standards will influence the work we do. [only include if the stream is live]

**March 14 - 15** We'll be at [WASM I/O](https://2024.wasmio.tech/) in Barcelona which really is becoming a highlight event. Be sure to say Hi if you're there and get your tickets early.

**March 19 - 22** We'll also be in Paris for [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU 2024](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/) and [Cloud Native Wasm Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/co-located-events/cloud-native-wasm-day/) plus a host of other co-located events. The [schedules](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/program/schedule/) are live!
