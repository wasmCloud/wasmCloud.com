### Meeting Notes
- **DEMO and DISCUSSION: A special signing showcase with Joonas and Dan**
- JOONAS: The team has been considering the value of releasing and signing Wolfi images.
- Wolfi is a “distroless” base layer for containers that is intended to be used to deploy production-hardened versions of software in containers.
- Benefit: statically-compiled down to the leanest possible container image.
- If we want to deploy a wasmCloud host inside a K8s cluster but want to avoid CVEs in the base image, Wolfi is a good choice. When using Wolfi-based images we get zero CVEs.
- Joonas and Dan are building a non-Debian version of wasmCloud, built as an OCI artifact on Wolfi to allow us access to the goodness in that ecosystem.
- Wasm by default is more secure than containers but we’re interested to see what it’s like to sign Wasm components. Joonas’s demo shows us how this is possible.
- SigStore’s existing tooling allows signing and verifying of container images and artifacts. SigStore is now able to sign OCI artifacts.
- Great for us: components stored in registries are OCI artifacts. How hard would it be for us to take a component that we built in wasmCloud and sign it? (It turns out it’s pretty easy…check out the recording for the demo)!
- Further reading on our [Policy Service](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/deployment/security/policy-service).
- DAN: There is another side to the discussion: build attestation.
- GitHub artifact attestation is now in public beta and so, along with SigStore, we wanted to do something similar with wasmCloud, integrated with GitHub.
- GitHub Action to attest builds. Attestation is different to signing as it deals with the CI/CD pipelines: “You can trust that this pipeline was the one that built the application.”
- In the Github UI, you can build, verify, sign and attest any build.
- The name of the certification is the pipeline tag where it originated.
- Both the SigStore and GitHub Build Attestation demos were pretty quick to implement due to the [Policy Service](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/deployment/security/policy-service) in wasmCloud, which is as flexible as you want it to be.

- **DEMO: Progress made with wRPC Go support—Roman**
- Link to Roman’s [wRPC Go implementation](https://github.com/wrpc/wrpc/tree/main/examples/go).
- Last week: We can now run and maintain applications, built with components written in Go, in a distributed way with wRPC.
- This week: Go provider with [outgoing HTTP contracts](https://www.notion.so/wasmCloud-Weekly-Notes-98f84ac55c4349dba9c399aa4ba064dc?pvs=21). Roman demos wRPC with support for futures and streams—optimized in ‘wit-bindgen-wrpc-go’.
- You can now write interfaces with futures and streams, ’wit-bindgen-wrpc-go’ will allow you to send HTTP requests with Go.
- Allows us to generate wRPC types in Go and turn these into capability providers.
- Streams and futures in go-bindgen and rust-bindgen.
- Only thing left is support for resources—should be complete this week.
- Imports wasi-http bindgen which generates some signing for resources but doesn’t yet manage them adequately.

**Q: Dan: Is there anything to look at around an example of how to implement futures and streams?**
- Roman: Joel’s project has support for async and futures but it’s early—wRPC protocol has support for these types.
- Bailey: Joel has done a huge amount of work inside wasmtools and wit-bindgen is expected to roll out with WASI 0.3.
- Catch the recording below for a more wide-ranging discussion on this topic.

- **DISCUSSION: [H2 roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7/views/10) check-in**
- We have already had significant movement in the wasmCloud roadmap. We have fixed a bug which has, fortuitously, turned into a cool feature improvement: CPU memory for restricted systems. Kudos to Taylor for progress there.
- This will now use Wasmtime dynamic pooling. Suited to smaller systems where there is inherently less memory.
- This will be included in the latest version of wash, designed for the smallest VMs and IoT use cases.
- Significant improvements in terms of single-button updates for crates, great to get that wrapped up. In wash 0.82 we almost entirely used that process; allowed us to deliver artifacts quicker.
- We released wasmCloud lattice client. You can see examples of usage in the wash repo. Hats off to Lachlan!
- In progress - some RFCs and docs continue to progress:
    - Wasm WG and Runtime TAG published recommendations for publishing Wasm artifacts in OCI.
    - We are adhering to as many standards as possible - work in progress.
- wasmCloud Postgres implementation - more to come here and we’re gearing up for a request for testing.

**Where we’ll be…**
- **16th May**: On [Cloud Native Live](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-cncf-online-programs-presents-cloud-native-live-advanced-nats-building-a-wasm-native-reconciliation-loop/), Taylor will join Synadia’s Jeremy Saenz to discuss the benefits of building a distributed Wasm-native reconciliation loop with NATS JetStream. Join to learn about key-value buckets, streams and work queues, how they work and why they matter. 12 midday ET.

**Tune in…**
- Bailey recently joined [Dan Lorenc at Chainguard](https://www.linkedin.com/events/chainguardxcosmonic-wasmcloud-d7191086372173086720/about/) to discuss all things Wasm, Kubernetes, distroless compute models and more. Tune in for this step-by-step exploration of Wasm.
- The CNCF and Bytecode Alliance [came together on CNCF Cloud Native Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Nv51foQ1mQ) for an interesting discussion on WASI 0.2 the Component Model..and the role of the BA in driving forward Wasm standards and tooling.
- Cloud Native Wasm Day [recordings](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2MQteKoXxICTWiUdZYEw6RI&feature=shared) are available! Particular highlights are presentations from our community users MachineMetrics and Orange.
- Check out the [Arm Developer Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDTHXGuqXAI) where Bailey and Liam discussed the intersection of Wasm and GPU technologies.
- Cosmonic CTO Bailey Hayes met Chris Matteson (Fermyon) and Oscar Spencer (F5 NGINX) on the panel at the [latest Kubernetes meetup in New York](https://www.meetup.com/new-york-kubernetes-meetup/events/297886914/). They explored the Wasm what’s, why’s, standards and considerations when adoption. [The recording is live!](https://youtu.be/ThcQNR-aVvI)
- Listen in to the last [WasmEdge community meeting](https://youtu.be/ttiE7g2Ojuk) where Bailey Hayes talks all things WASI 0.2 and we hear from the students of the University of Tokyo on some cool new projects.
- Bailey was a guest on a recent [Rancher Live podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPdzvL59tIA) with Divya Mohan. Tune in for a deep dive into WASI 0.2!
