## Meeting Notes

### DEMO: inspecting component wit with `wash inspect`

- wasm community tooling: `wasm-tools component wit ./foo_s.component.wasm`
- `wash inspect --wit [artifact]` will now do the same!
  - uses `wasmparser` library under the hood (just like `wasm-tools`)
- this is part of incremental support for components in wash
  - coming soon: validating imports/exports before runtime invocation
- advanced components functionality will be left to `wasm-tools`

### DISCUSSION: wasmCloud 1.0 Roadmap

- the [roadmap link](/docs/roadmap/) will be updated regularly
  - this is a living document
- wasmCloud has been using "Now", "Next", "Later" to convey priority
- moving forward, we will use numbered milestones: "1.0", "1.1", "1.2", "2.0", etc.
- incremental improvements are always welcome and don't need to wait for a specify milestone (as long as they're not breaking changes)
- wasmCloud's goals remain the same:
  - seamless devX
  - avoid vendor lock-in
  - leverage as many Wasm standards as possible
  - leverage cloud-native standards where possible
- 1.0 milestone split into three primary categories
  - stabilization of APIs (RPC, events, control interface, etc.)
  - Wasm standards (WASI P2 wit deps, wasmtime 16, componentized examples & docs)
  - core wasmCloud functionality (multiple versions of entities, OTEL metrics, secrets management, etc.)
- most of the remaining work can be parallelized
  - check for the `good first issue` label if you're new and want to contribute!
- some existing functionality (e.g. modules, current APIs) will be deprecated in 1.0, but support will remain until 2.0
