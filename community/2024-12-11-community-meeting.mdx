## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### DEMO: wasmCloud benchmarks

- CT to add recording notes after the fact - missed the start of the meeting. Or Eric to add his notes here (not essential)
- As always, it is difficult to extole the beauty of the demo in notes, please take a look a the recording to witness Lucas in action in full glory.
- Lucas demos xxxxxx
- Colin: what do you see you'll be testing the nost? RPC transport is part of it. Crucially, HTTP provider/HTTP component - elements that we need to grind on. Also, replicating application behaviour. For instance, where a component that is API garetway is receiving and sending reqests to more than 2 components downstream. Lifecycle handler, logging system etc. Introducing varying numbers of downstream requests and latencies so we mirror behaviours. WASI messaging is a key consideration when we consider testing metholoigies.
- Also important; mapping individual performance for each transport; TCP, NATS etc. and understanding the performance characteristics of these, which helps us understand where to use different transport types.
- Overall more performance benchmarking as a whole - the aim is to get these built into each release so raising the bar on an ongoing basis. Numbers we can depend on.

### DISCUSSION: Enzo Nocera's (raskyld) [Rust Leptos web framework contributions](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/2024-12-10-leptos-and-wasi-0.2-for-full-stack-wasm-development) with added WASI 0.2.0 support.

- Our wonderful commununity user, Enzo Nocera (better known as [raskyld](https://github.com/raskyld) has been working on a fascinating project, originally presented to the community in wasmCloud Wednesday, [October 30th edition](https://wasmcloud.com/community/2024/10/30/community-meeting). Now, we have published all the details in a [blog post](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/2024-12-10-leptos-and-wasi-0.2-for-full-stack-wasm-development).
- This details Enzo's contribution to Rust's Leptos web framework that now has added WASI 0.2.0 support.
- Why is this exciting? Leptos is a very popular full-syack
- Implemeing the bindings and making it work with WASI 0.2
- You can write full-stack web apps in Rust and then compile to the stable WASI 0.2 target. You can run this in Wasmtime, and wasmCloud - you can run on any Wasm untime,
- It has http as the file system - which is great to work with.
- In particular, check out Enzo's excellent report on the reasoning behind this project and how the integration work.
This is just the latest example of how WASI 0.2 is such a sweet, uplifting development for the entire WebAssembly community.
- Thank you Enzo for sharing the details of this interesting project. We look forward to seeing what comes next.

### DISCUSSION: wasmCloud [Q4 roadmap check-in](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7/views/12) - 2 weeks to quarter end.

- We are just a couple of weeks away from the end of the year. As such, this is a great moment to check in on the wasmCloud roadmap.
- The benchmarking suite discussed earlier will soon make its way into the roadmap so watch out for that.
- There's been a ton of progress in the Quickstart. In the next versuon of wash (new features for wash dev) we'll be able to say the Quickstart has grown x3 in size!
- WASI control commands are making progress - thanks to our fantastic community contributors for the work there!
- Our own Massoud has made serious progress on the NATS object store implementation for wasi-blobstore - thank you Massoud!
- Multi-tenancy in wasmCloud has some excellent comments and this will remain a focus going into the New Year.
- CTA - there are a couple of really good first issues that are a perfect starting point for new contributors. If folks are looking to get a feel for how this works, and make a quick conribution, take a look at the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7/views/12) in Github and tab to Q424! If you want to contribute, just drop a note in the issue!
- Thank you to every contributor, old and new, for the hard work this year!

### Tune in…
