## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### DEMO: A better `wash spy`

- As always, it's difficult to share the demo goodness in notes so check out the recording below.
- `wash spy` provides a component provider ID; how it is running in wasmcloud.
- This subscribes to all the invocations - if youre dubugging a component and looking at what is going over the lattice - it's a great command to get an entire readout, allows us to focus in on an individual component.
- We have 2 apps deployed - echo and K-V counter - Brooks shows what it looks like to spy on a component.
- We can send a request to the topic that the comonent is subscribed on - e.g. hello there - we can see what wash was able to synthesize.
- We noticed the message isn't that useful - we found out that this is a remnant from when we encoded the paylaods with message pack - we now use the standard Wasm component encoding proposal - how wRPC works over the lattice.
- Brooks shows how we've updated the `wash spy` command and what it looks like now to spy on the invocations of a component - sounds bad, good for debugging!
- We have a ton of great debugging features in `wash` - worth checking out.
- More to come on improvements on the debugging side of things to come soon!

### DISCUSSION: Provider SDK updates and improvements

- These improvements are focused on the Rust provider SDK - 1 will also come to Go.
- Thanks to Victor for updating capability provider configuration - in wasmCloud 1.2 we will have support for configuration updates. Provide a certificate for a provider to connect, or a token.
- We will file an issue on the Go Provider SDK shortly.
- On the Provider SDK in Rust: when we delete a link in a provider we would hand you the source ID of the componejt if you're targeted wth a link. We now provide a more fulsome set of information for deleteing a link. 
- This means you'll gave more robust information re. what the link is - source, target, link name - without these it's difficult to make capability providers multi-tenant so this is a useful way to resolve this challenge.
- Provider SDK in Rust - breaking change - release notes to follow. 

### DISCUSSION: From .NET to MoonBit; the growing spectrum of Wasm component languages

- It's really exciting to see the range of languages supported by Wasm grow. We already have a range of languages with full support but it's fantastic to see new languages coming through.
- MoonBit is a really great example of a [language adding Wasm component model support](https://gist.github.com/mizchi/47ba840722f593a32a0587df334ee2f2) - this is a great [blog post](https://www.moonbitlang.com/blog/component-model) on the subject.
- Language support for C++ C# has been progressing really quickly - these are our most requested languages along with .NET.
- .NET is progressing quickly also - take a look at the [work being done](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-dotnet) and the [PR here]( https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-dotnet/pull/32).
- .Net 9 will have support for WASI 0.2! Watch out a demo of a .NET component in future weeks.

## Weekly highlights

### Issue of the Week

- [Apply sort to `wash` get outputs](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/2772)
  - The current Hashmap format isn't easy to digest and do we're delighted to see some innovation happening here. More detail in the PR and start contributing to this good first issue.

### Documentation of the Week

- [Deploy with Akamai LKE](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/deployment/k8s/akamai)
  - This deployment guide demonstrates how to deploy wasmCloud to a Kubernetes cluster using Akamai's Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE) service, and then run wasmCloud applications built from WebAssembly components.

- Also, shameless plug for the [Cloud Native Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Q_Xx5i6Ek) featuring how to deploy wasmCloud on Akamai LKE at the edge. This is a fantastic example of wasmCloud working across diverse environments and clearly sets out the benefits of containers versus components in cloud native deployments.

## Community Updates

- Check out [wasmCloud contrib](https://github.com/wasmCloud/contrib) for the lowdown on how our community is working with wasmCloud! Some fantastic use cases here.
- The [WasmCon 2024 schedule](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/wasmcon/program/schedule/) is live! Take a look to see who'll be on stage, and the workshops planned. This should be a great show.
