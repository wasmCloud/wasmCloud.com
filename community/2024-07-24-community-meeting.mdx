## Meeting Notes

### DEMO: secrets-nats-kv backend CLI, `wash secret`, `wash keys gen curve`

- As always, it's difficult to capture the goodness of this demo in notes and so please check out the recording below.
- We are working towards releasing all this new functionality in 1.1.
- You may have noticed we're working on Secrets support in wasmCloud and may have seen a recent example in main under [example/security/secrets](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples/security/secrets).
- Uses a provider that authenticates with Redis and uses the wasmCloud functionality to apply this to a component.
- Today, we're walking through a new version of this example that depends on a couple of unreleased tools (wash latest etc) but it's important to note these are all standard binary examples.
- What this shows is how wasmCloud supports storing encrypted Secrets in a NATS bucket.
- This is important as for many of the larger organizations looking at adopting Wasm Secrets support is essential.
- Watch the demo below for all the details and the wider discussion, and follow along in the [README](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/examples/security/secrets/README.md).
- Side note: Will this be WASI-Secrets - we hope so!
- Thank you to the wider Wasm community and wasmCloud maintainers for the work dedicated to this important update.
- Sub-command in wash
- Wadm Support for secrets

### DISCUSSION: Secrets support in Golang provider SDK

- Resource: check out the latest post on our [Go Provider SDK](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/go-provider-sdk) and how we can [Compile Go directly to WebAssembly components with TinyGo and WASI P2](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/compile-go-directly-to-webassembly-components-with-tinygo-and-wasi-p2).
- Continuing the Secrets theme, we're excited to show how we've added Secrets support in our Golang provider SDK.
- As part of the updates in the main wasmCloud repo we needed to update the capability provider in Rust to support Secrets.
- Backwards compatible- work with newer versions of the host and only the Secrets fields are encrypted.
- Tl;Dr bringing providers that doesn't know about Secrets be no issue (as long we you don't try to give it a Secret).
- Capability Providers in Rust will be updated to support Secrets - Postgres (connection string/password). Moving to remove plain text.
- The Golang provider also needed to be updated too to support Secrets. This just landed earlier today!
- The Golang Provider SDK now supports the same features as the Rust Provider SDK.
- Secrets are passed to the provider encrypted using a key that only the host knows about.
- In Go the use of Secrets is simple: update and integrate.
- Take look at the demo to see how this looks. Couchbase Support in WasmCloud is tied to this. Check out how these two elements tie together in the recording.
- Release notes to follow.

### DISCUSSION: `wasi-messaging@0.2.0-draft` updates

- There has been a lot of discussion on the interface and functionality in the WebAssembly [repo](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-messaging/pull/23). Take a look for the update and discussion.
- Colin: Use case: how do we handle latency if we continue to handle processing within the component?
- Edge is the obvious use case. Reducing network traffic: if we receive a request we want to send a response immediately. If there is additional processing will delay the response. If linked to HTTP, can we set responses? Possible trade off.
- Watch the recording for the full discussion.
- Brooks, do we want to add something here? I am not sure what we concluded.

## Weekly highlights

### Doc of the week: [Capability Catalog](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/capabilities/)

- We noticed that it's hard to look at wasmCloud as a project and find out what is available to use!
- Voila! This Capability Catalog talks at a very high level about the capabilities (WIT worlds) that are available and the capability providers (inc. Couchbase provider) that are freely accessible.
- [Take a look](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/capabilities/)!

### Catch up…

- [Open Observability Talks podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2xIoVNwtKM): Taylor joined Dotan Horovitz to discuss all things WebAssembly, and how it is the next frontier in the evolution of cloud native computing. This was a great session - recommended listening.
- [ShipIt!](https://changelog.com/shipit/110): Bailey and Taylor joined the good folks over at Changelog's ShipIt! podcast to discuss WebAssembly Standard Interfaces (WASI), trade-offs for portable interfaces and why WebAssembly is the Kubernetes of Lambda.
