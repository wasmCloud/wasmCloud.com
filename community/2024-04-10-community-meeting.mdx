### Meeting Notes

- **DISCUSSION: [wasmCloud 1.0](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/roadmap) Showcase**
- In today’s session we show off all the goodness coming down the line in wasmCloud 1.0.
- In his demo, Brooks shows how we’ve made some significant changes to the [wasmCloud QuickStart](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/tour/hello-world): take a look and watch the recording to learn what’s new and improved.
- There are some serious performance changes across wasmCloud—feels really snappy and responsive.
- What’s great to see is component support become real, live in wasmCloud. Again, recommend reviewing the demo—there’s only so much we can express in notes.
- Scale and distribute section will be particularly interesting to many:
  - We know that we can scale components and connect wasmCloud in a distributed way.
  - We can now distribute wasmCloud hosts globally, scheduled in Wadm, no matter where our applications need to run. Take a look at our docs which show you how to do this!
- There was a wide-ranging discussion during this section which we recommend checking out.

- **DISCUSSION: [1.0 Release Candidate](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/discussions/1855): call for testing**
- Everything we see in the previous demo uses the latest release version of wash in the new wasmCloud quickstart.
- [Direct link to installation](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation) which outlines status on individual elements.
- There are a ton of small fixes that we’re working on that we identified when testing quickstart but we are pretty much ready to unveil the latest release candidate.
- We really need you to take a look and test the release!
- If you have existing workloads to migrate to 1.0, this is a really good moment to do this.
- Recommend using [wash-cli v0.27.0-alpha.2](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/releases/tag/wash-cli-v0.27.0-alpha.2) to test this release as it includes all new client libraries, tools, and pins to 1.0 rc.1.
- The goals is to make sure we don’t have breaking changes or new features we want to add.
- Calling out specifically the updates to the WASI key-value interface that make it nicer to use on the components side. This will also make it easier on our end; removing the need to to adapt to a new interface when things change.
- Taylor also gives a fantastic summary on the wasi-cloud side of things; interface is now more cleanly-named and has documentation guarantees. Recommend watching his presentation.
  - No additional dependencies - simplification and ease of use.
