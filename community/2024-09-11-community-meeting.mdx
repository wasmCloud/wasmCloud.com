## Agenda

{/* Update before the start of the meeting with planned agenda items */}

### **DEMO: Go component testing with Roman**

- Roman has been working on a Wasm test framework - firstly in Go as that’s where our focus is right now. [PoC link](https://github.com/rvolosatovs/west) for your delectation.
- We’re calling this west. The main feature is this lets us compile our components and test against a WASI platform harness that supports the functionality we’re testing.
- What this means is we can use pure developer tools out of the box, nothing unusual required here.
- In this demonstration Roman shows what this testing program looks like and how it works.
- Grabs all the Go files in my imports and replace all Wasm imports with those provided by wasmtime.
- Debugs as a normal native application.
- Essentially, this constructs an HTTP request then call the export handler and make assumptions based on how the component responds. This has been difficult to do until now.
- Makes it possible to have full coverage on production functionality at runtime.
- As always, it’s really difficult to express the goodness of the demo so please check out the recording below.
- Also, check out the wider community discussion in the playback.
- CTA: We’ll have WASI functionality to add to custom interfaces next week and so stay tuned for that.

### **DEMO: [Component SDK for Go](https://github.com/wasmCloud/component-sdk-go) - update with Lucas**

- We can use this if we want to use a standard wasm component in Go. This is the workflow that we would use.
- Go-native, essentially an idiomatic way to build Go-native WebAssembly components.
- The one we currently have in wasmCloud generates Go and C files - that’s pretty much how wit-bindgen works today.
- If we look at components that use wit-bindgen Go, you’ll see a diff set of files that wil be 100% Go - C doesn’t get a look in.
- We are now using a different bindgen that is hosted in ByteCode Alliance tools.
- How will this change things?
- If we take a look at the interface names, there’s a lot of text - code that is hard to read.
- When we look at the new generator, things become more ‘Go-like’ when interacting with any WASI object, we no longer have the package names - it points to the correct Go package and the actual names - package stream, input stream etc.
- This is a much more streamlined way of working!
- This means streaming is now possible in Go with this component SDK - and you can run it with any runtime that is wasi:http compliant.
- Check out the examples that Lucas mentions [here](https://github.com/wasmCloud/component-sdk-go/tree/main/_examples/http-server).
- This is a great demo which we can’t do justice in notes, catch up with the demo and the wider discussion in the recording below.

### **DEMO: wasmCloud roadmap progress**

- Steady progress in the [Q3 roadmap](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/roadmap/).
- Making good progress - we want to thank everyone in the community for taking on these issues - super grateful to the entire community for driving significant progress. You rock!
- Tons of progress on: sharing components and providers, sharing resources, consolidating wasmCloud Helm chart and much, much more!
- Please take a look at the roadmap to identify all the good first issues ready for contribution - we’re excited for more of you to get involved.
- Check out the recording for the wider discussion on progress and what comes next.

### **REMINDER: wasmCloud Innovation Day - 1 week to go!**

- We are super excited that wasmCloud Innovation Day is just a week away.
- If you haven’t registered yet, you can do so [here](https://wasmcloud.com/innovation-day).
- We’ll have talks on how wasmCloud is being used in industry (Akamai, Adove, MachineMetrics), a discussion with Wasm industry leaders Pat Hickey (Fastly), Yosh Wuyts (Microsoft), and a host of technical demos from your friendly, neighbourhood wasmCloud maintainers.
- Please note the wasmCloud community meeting will take place at 10am ET next week and on a different link - we’ll publish the updated link and diary entry shortly!
