## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### DEMO: `wash` and `wadm` developer experience improvements

- As always, notes can only tell so much. Check out the recording for the full demo.
- wasmCloud branch - this is public (prs list).
- We've changed the way we display tables in `wash` - for longer pieces of information.
- We've also updated the app status command in `wadm` which is a really useful development.
- If we run `wash app list`, we can see a fresh view. Descriptions are nested in the table underneath. Much easier way to capture this detail.
- If we deploy an app, we did not always get the version back from the app. Now we always get the version back, even if we don't specify it.
- Our new `wash app status` command is well worth a look. In `wash` and `wadm` we're now surfacing the top level status info + all the scaler info for each application.
- We also have a new feature in `wadm`: currently, failed state if you request configuration that can't be supported. We now have a new way to report status in the app manifest; in reconciliation we can see the app has failed, more importantly we can see the *reason* it failed.
- App status command is getting a lot more useful - in app status in `wadm` there will always be an event that says it started and if it didn't why. 
- All of this is up in a PR and we're looking to release in the next minor releases of `wash` and `wadm`. More to come.

### DISCUSSION: `wash` 0.30.0 and wasmcloud-operator update

- Calling out that `wash` 0.30.0 and updates to the wasmcloud-opereator are complete.
- [Operator](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/tree/main): undergoing quick development (secrets and OTEL), all making their way into the operator.
- With a more streamlined README.
- The wasmCloud annotated yaml includes details on the various options available in the wasmcloud-operator - super helpful for those of us that are getting used to all the ways we can work with the operator.

### DISCUSSION: wasmCloud 1.1 is here!

- We're super excited to release wasmCloud 1.1: all the highlights on the [blog](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/wasmcloud-1.1-brings-secrets-support-and-more-enhancements-for-enterprises)
- Included in `wash` 0.30.0.
- Take a look, in particular, to the new Couchbase and Postgres interfaces - major developments that fit with what engineers are asking for.
- Rust and Go are both on the same level of support. Custom provider templates with Go are ready for use. Go + secrets is also new! Compile Go to components. Go provider SDK. And more.
- 1.1 is the culmination of many of the elements that were completed in the Q2 roadmap. We will look towards .2, .3 in the next few months. More to follow.

## Weekly highlights

- WASI 0.2.1 is out! Check out the post on the [BA blog](https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/WASI-0.2.1). Kudos Bailey and the W3C WASI SG.

### Documentation of the Week

- Huge shout out to Dan and Eric for putting the lion's share of this documentation together.
- This is a comprehensive guide to how secrets work - highly recommended.
