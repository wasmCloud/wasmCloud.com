## Meeting Notes

- Firstly, announcing that Colin Murphy (Adobe) is now a project maintainer for the wasmCloud org and wash maintainer. Colin's been collaborating with us for many years so this is long overdue. We are delighted!

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### UPDATE: wasmCloud 1.3 features and fixes

- As always it's difficult to capture all the points discussed, and the Q&A, check out the recording below for the full details.
- We will be publishing a developer blog post with all the details shortly so keep an eye on the wasmCloud blog and social channels.
- wash dev is the major update in 1.3 which provides a way for us to review component dependencies in full.
- [Release notes](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/releases/tag/v1.3.0) are tagged along with the 1.3 release.
- Notably, we have introduced a new validation path for links. Earlier, you cauld have an http server provider forwarded to components based on a path. We used ot be able to do this with the same inteface without specifying a link name - this is now invalid.
- What must be present to create a link from the same source o multipe targes, you must soecufy the kink name - a unuqie idejtifier for calling a specific target at runtime,
- Works by extenson for cap providers - htto triggered by an external handler.
- Wasm componet context requires additional identifcation layer.
- Check out the recording for [Massoud's](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/examples/rust/components/keyvalue-messaging/src/lib.rs) example - a great way to demo why we need this feature. In your code you can denote you're calling 2 different locations, identified with link names.
- Another [example in our documentation}(https://wasmcloud.com/docs/concepts/linking-components/linking-at-runtime/#defining-and-using-link-names) for a guide to using links.

### DISCUSSION: [Embedding wasmcloud and wadm in wash](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/1061)

- One of the key elements on the wasmCloud Q4 roadmap. A key one is embedding wasmCloud and wadm in wash.
- V1 - wadm and wasnckoud are both binaries and crates. As such, we can start a wasmcloud host and wadm but embedded in wash.
- When we run wash up, once we've ensured we are running NATS locally, wadm and wasmCloud can run within the same process as wash.
- Why is this important? This allows us to handle errors better and make it easier to short-circuit runtime errors.
- It ensures there are no runaway proceses and it's quicker, 2 less binaries to download from Github.
- Jordis: what is driving this, are there quick wins to push readiness? Comment: getting ahead on docs that provide visual simplicity is desired.
- Brooks: The origin started in realizing it can be frictionful to download through Github - proxies cause issues for enterprises. We want to make it easier to work locally with less requirements for external access - tricky when there's poor connectivity, esp if you're being asked to take more steps.
-  There was a much broader discussion, check out the recording for the full discussion.


### DISCUSSION: [wasmCloud Q4 roadmap](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/discussions/3119)

- Last week we did our Q4 roadmapping session which was super productive.
- The [Q4 roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7/views/12) is now live in Github projects, with a host of good first issues in triage.
- In the Ready for Work section, you'll see we have a higher ratio of good first issues - perfect for those who are looking to get started.
- We have already started on a number of Q4 issues and so check out the [repo](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7/views/12) for all the details.
- For Q4 we will be prepping for WasmCon + KubeCon, taking place in Salt Lake City in 3.5 weeks. We'll be there in force and so be sure to stop along our Project Booth on the Wednesday 13th November.
- Check out the wide-ranging discussion - recording below. 

## Community Updates

- Join us in Salt Lake City for WasmCon and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 11 - 15 November. We're stoked to see so many talks exploring wasmCloud, check out the schedues to see when we're on stage, and visit the wasmCloud booth in the Project Paviliion on the afternoon/evening of Wednesday 13th (booth crawl) - we're looking forward to seeing you!
