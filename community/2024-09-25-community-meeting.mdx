## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### DEMO: Update on Go component testing with `WAdge` - Roman

- As always, it's difficult to capture the goodness of Roman's demo so please check out the recording below!
- This project changed names from west to WAdge for a couple of reasons. west is already a project name, it has also changed its purpose a little.
- WAdge is designed to be a bridge between native code and components.
- WAdge lets us access functionality supported by components in your native code. For instance importing native libraries to your component and testing that component.
- This is extremely useful for the testing of components as if they are native code running on your system. It allows you to test your component in your own environment with your *own tools' debug etc.
- wasi-http and nothing extra but we can go one level deeper. If we want to use custom providers for specific use cases - this is also supported in WAdge.
- Check out the recording to see how it works and listen to the wider discussion.

### DEMO: Backstage Plugin (beta) - Lachlan

- As above, it's super difficult to capture the goodness of Lachlan's demo so please check out the recording below!
- Backstage is an important component of the enterprise toolkit so we're pleased to show progress on our Backstage Plugin, currently in beta.
- We have been talking to the community to find out what people are using. Backstage is gaining a lot of traction - it is a CNCF project donated by Spotify - a way to surface all of the different pieces of their platform internally amongst their various teams.
- We are focusing first on the software catalog - service interface that shares information about your application, available throughout the platform, so you can see what you already have and reuse it where possible. 
- Consume and API, build a component and share that amongst disparate teams to be consumed in other parts of the organization.
- See status, config, construction, status overview then reconfig, reuse existing software = cost and resource efficiencies.
- More info on [Backstage Plugins](https://backstage.io/plugins).
- Check out Lachlan's demo in the recording below to see how he analyzes a Wadm manifest by connecting wasmCloud to Backstage.

### DISCUSSION: Changes to `wash build` target 

- Upcoming changes to wash build. This started as a way to build components in languages that wasmCloud knows - Rust, TinyGo etc.
- One specific aspect will improve - the way we build source code to a Wasm component, Rust toolchain blog is a good reference point.
- As we move forward we have just updated to the latest verson of wash - to Wasm32 WASI P1. Brooks - add element on connector step.
- Once Wasm32 WASI P2 is included in the standard toolchain, we'll update wash to use this directly.
- TinyGo components will also compile to the WASI P2 target, which means we can use native TinyGo toolchains.
- Targeting P2 will be the standard default when you're running wash build. 
- This way we ensure you're always using the latest and greatest, out of the box with wasmCloud.

### DISCUSSION: Shared wadm application components

- We're making some changes to shared wadm application components. There is a PR in flight that implements most of what this means.
- If we have 2 diff apps that we manage we have to launch http server capability providers in both - even though it's just 1 component.
- Providers are designed to be multi-tenant and so we're moving towards this model with shared providers and components.
- Now we can write as many apps as we want and only need one shared provider. Path-based routing etc.
- Check out the recording of an exanples of a shared http component and how this model works.
- Will land in the next version of wadm along with a couple of examples of how it can be used.


### DISCUSSION: Q4 roadmap, call for new issue candidates

- wasmCloud Q4 is imminent and this is a great opportunity for you to have your say on what you'd like us to work on.
- We will be finalizing the Q4 roadmap 2 weeks from now to grab issues, features, fixes etc. Join us for the planning session.
- If there's a feature or improvement you'd like to see, now's your chance to get it on the agenda.
- For now, please give this some thought and join the discussion on Slack and in the [discussion in the repo](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/discussions/3119) - we look forward to your thoughts.
