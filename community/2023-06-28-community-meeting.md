### Agenda

- DEMO: System information provider
- DISCUSSION: Link names, when to use them, and other use cases
  - Specifically, I want to talk about the use cases we've designed link names for, and what use cases they don't work with today.
  - I'd like to brainstorm ways to make link names easier to use and see if we can expand the use cases that they are meant for.
