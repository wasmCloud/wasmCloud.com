## Meeting Notes

### Secrets demo

- Brooks has brought a demo application that shows off wasmCloud's new secret support&mdash;essentially a modified version of the Redis kvcounter example. When performing the usual `curl` against the app, he gets an `unauthorized` response. If he gives a password, he _can_ authenticate. This is a wasmCloud application comprised of a component and two providers, one of which is a modified Redis keyvalue provider.

- **The wasmCloud host makes the request to fetch a secret**, not the provider. This works with a new interface called `wasmcloud:secrets`.

- In this example, **the secret is stored in a NATS keyvalue bucket using a [NATS keyvalue backend](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates/secrets-nats-kv)**. A Vault backend is expected to drop next week.

- wasmCloud's secret support is the first **reference implementation for what could be a `wasi:secrets` interface**.

- Brooks walks through the [secrets RFC](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/issues/2190), highlighting that the wasmCloud host itself isn't actually storing any values. The values themselves are stored in your secrets store (a NATS key-value store in this case) and the secret is entirely encrypted on the message bus&mdash;the host decrupts the secret with an xkey.

- Secret names and tied to specific components or providers' workload identities. Each secret _can_ be scoped to a specific component in a specific application, but can also be used more generally.

- A given secrets backend (for example, a provider like the modified kvredis provider Brooks has brought) can serve secrets to multiple components or providers.

- You can also fetch secrets from multiple secrets backends.

### Roadmap check-in

- With a couple weeks to go, it's a good time to check in on the Q2 roadmap. While we have a number of issues open, we've accomplished a ton, and our major priorities like secrets are landing now.

- Question/comment: It can sometimes be difficult to understand how to start contributing for a given issue. It might be a good idea to focus on just a couple of issues and then fleshing out the articulation of those issues so it's easier for contributors to jump in.

- Brooks: We've completed a lot, and we want to maintain velocity, but it's definitely a good idea to hold ourselves to a high standard for making these issues accessible.

### wRPC updates

- Roman has been working on the Rust transport abstraction, making wRPC easier to use and more efficient. It now goes all in on tokio. We also have a wasm-tokio crate.

- We also now have QUIC transport which can be used as an alternative to NATS. The wRPC protocol is designed to be transport-agnostic, and this provides a new option.
