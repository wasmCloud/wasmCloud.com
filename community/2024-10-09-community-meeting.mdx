## Meeting Notes

Today's meeting is focused on community roadmapping for Q4.

### Q3 Retrospective

* As we've discussed in past meetings, we want to accelerate our release cadence for minor versions, so we won't use minor version releases as a milestone like we did in Q3.
* Looking back on currently in-progress roadmap features, several (like `wash dev` and an all-in-one Helm chart are well underway in PRs).
* For triaged features, a configuration file for hosts will be nice to have in the future, but it isn't a necessary priority at the moment.
* Brooks: As far as retrospective goes, I'm very happy because we wanted 50% of issues to be taken by community contributors rather than contributors, and we've seen an amazing amount of community contribution.

### Q4 Roadmapping

* Brooks: I'd like Q4 to be a polish quarter, focusing on making the experience better in a wholesale way.
* Docs suggestion: Surfacing capability provider documentation (already existing in readmes) on the docs site, along with other existing documentation in readmes.
* Docs suggestion: Auto-generate wasmCloud host documentation much as we've done with the wash CLI.
* Docs suggestion: Revisit wasmCloud quickstart to bring it up to date with the latest refinements across both the wasmCloud ecosystem and language toolchains.
* Feature suggestion: Using the provider SDK, it would be helptful to be able to run provider testing against the version of the host in main branch, to help provider developers keep up with a rapid pace of change.
* Discussion: We need documentation for handling resources in custom capability providers.
* Feature suggestion: Use human time instead of milliseconds for time values. (Aditya would like to take this one.)
* Feature suggestion: Add autocompletion to CLI.
* Feature suggestion: Reflect unhealthy providers in application status.
* Feature suggestion: Produce a benchmark suite that we can update/publish regularly.
* Feature suggestion: Make wasmcloud.toml location configurable.
* Feature suggestion: wash commands that take a host ID shouldn't require it if there's only one locally.
* Feature suggestion: Deprecate `wash app list` in favor of `wash app get` since they use the same API - generally useful to consolidate similar subcommands and reduce the number you need to remember.
* Feature suggestion: Address ComponentSpecification race conditions.
