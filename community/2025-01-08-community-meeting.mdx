## Meeting Notes

### Joonas on `wasmCloud/go`

* Joonas showed off the `wasmCloud/go` GitHub repository that consolidates Go libraries, examples, and templates for easier discoverability. (Exception is `wadge` -- since it's a bunch of different technologies, we're not sure yet whether it belongs here.)
* There's an `x` namespace for experimental ideas. For example, there's an OpenTelemetry exporter that can be used to utilize OTEL libraries and export signals from within a component. There are some caveats for usage, so it's not quite ready for top-level availability, but it's accessible if you want to try it.

### Lachlan on `wasmCloud/typescript`

* On a similar note, Lachlan demonstrated the `wasmCloud/typescript` GitHub repository that consolidates TypeScript libraries, examples, and templates, as well as the washboard app. 
* Releases to npm will happen from this repository.
* This repository will also serve as the source for examples automatically propagated to the docs site, as examples in the Go repo are already doing.

### Taylor shares example propagation to docs

* Taylor implemented scripts to check the Go repo nightly and populate the docs site with example pages derived from the readmes for examples.
* This enhances both discoverability and maintainability for the examples.
* The Go examples are live now and will be fleshed out and iterated on further in the days and weeks ahead; other language examples will join them as well. 

### Colin's `c2pa-component` project

* Colin showed off an application that reads [C2PA content credential](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/c2patool/) data for an image. 
* C2PA helps to define provenance for images -- a sort of "SBOM for content" per Joonas.
* Colin's app works by composing two components written in different languages, Rust and TypeScript. It is available to check out at [https://github.com/cdmurph32/c2pa-component](https://github.com/cdmurph32/c2pa-component)

### Discussion: Question - How can we anticipate releases for interfaces?

* Bailey: For interfaces in the WASI namespace without `draft` appended at the end, releases are monthly, following a "train" model until the release of WASI 0.3.
* New versions of draft interfaces can be cut at any time since the point of those is to iterate quickly.
* We also roll `wasmcloud` namespaced versions of upstream WASI interfaces at a slower pace for stability reasons. 

### Discussion: Q1 planning

* Join us next week for Q1 planning.
