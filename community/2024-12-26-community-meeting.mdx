Welcome our new community member, Danesh who has a particular interest in eliminating cold-start issues in serverless functions. SpinKube is a particular interest area, but is now joining the wasmCloud community meeting for the first time. Welcome, Danesh!

### Discussion: wasmCloud project templates

- In the [Quickstart](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/tour/hello-world) when you first get started with a component, we `wash new component` and a specific template name. These templates are sourced from a [toml file in the wash library crate](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/crates/wash-lib/src/generate/favorites.toml).
- The toml file outlines all the templates that wasmCloud can genetrate from. Each template is a well-defined pace that has an existing example that has been scaffolded-out for folks to get started with.
- There are quite a few templates there already; some categorized by components such as application binaries, or capability provders; host plugins to implement a specific interface for a Wasm app.
- We wanted to update the Go hello-world template which needed a small fix and to be moved to the Go repo where we host all our Golang SDKs and examples. How we maintain these templates is a consideration, especially where we're saving them in different repos. By keeping Go examples centrally, this makes it easier for maintainers to keep project templates updated.
- How does the community feel about the way we maintain templates? Go maintainers looking for us to simplify.
- Having a static toml file that points to the templates is more frictionful than is necessary. No objections to templates being in a different repo. Repo for wasmCloud where project templates live.
- Lachlan: organizing around languages is good because it's how developers think. We can compare between languages but most of the time the decision is already made. Keeping these pieces together will make it easier to create tooling that is language-specific. Templates and examples the same treatment - examples in my preferred language. wasmcloud/typescript wasmcloud/Go etc.
- Important: unification to make sure that if we use multiple repos they are consistent, Taylor has started on work in Go, to pull changes to docs in Github autonatically to the docs site so they become more easily discoverable. Docs site becomes the authority. The ability to pull in a consistent naming format and having docs that exist alongside the component is powerful.
- Templates in line with examples, and separation is important as they can be tested in line with their differences. But language specific repos is the ideal. /Go - all things Go.
- Check out the recording for the full details and join us on [Slack](https://wasmcloud.slack.com/) to continue the discussion.


### [Q1 2025 Roadmap Discussion](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/discussions/3813)

- We have started thinking about the [Q1 2025 roadmap](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/discussions/3813), and have created a place for community members to share ideas. Take a look at the comments and questions currently in discussion as we set the high level initiatives for the project.
- We are casting out for ideas, suggestions, bug reports, feature ideas and must-haves for the next quarter so this is your chance to have your say.
- Thanks again to [Masoud (@ossfellow)](https://github.com/ossfellow) for your comments and feedback.
- You'll see some interesting prospective work in AI - this will be a bit of a focus in the next few months.
- Roadmap planning will take place in the next couple of weeks so please join the weekly community meeting on the 2nd January.

### Open Discussion
- [Masoud (@ossfellow)](https://github.com/ossfellow): Using Leptos in the context - demo banking app - front end is using React if data needs to be streamed back to front end how does ut work in that context? 
- [Lachlan (@lachieh)](https://github.com/lachieh) It is standard HTTP calls but as far as Leptos is concerned, we belive the front end loads a Wasm module that generates javascript and html that the browser then loads - this calls the Wasm module - RPC call over HTTP, using its own Leptos system protocol.
- Check out this [blogpost on the subject](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/2024-12-10-leptos-and-wasi-0.2-for-full-stack-wasm-development) - Leptos and WASI 0.2 for full-stack Wasm development.
- Review the recording below for the full discusson.

- Masoud: What is the status of WASI P3? Looking for something around HTTP2 specifically? wasi-io is tricky.
- [Bailey (@ricochet)](https://github.com/ricochet): 1. When we're talking about .3 we are focusing on priorities. Being able to add HTTP2 can happen any time. 2. GRPC is the driver for HTTP2 - consensus has not yet been reached on how we support this, but there are a number of options on the table - separate implementation for HTTP2 is as possibility but no firm decisions as yet.

### Tune in…

{/* Add any upcoming events/streams/etc */}

- The [wasmCloud Innovation Day](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/discussions/3813) sessions are currently being uploaded to the Platform Engineering playlist on our YouTube channel! There are already some great sessions listed in this playlist - check it out and keep an eye on the blog for related posts.
- This week, [Brooks (@brooksmtownsend)](https://github.com/brooksmtownsend) dives into Secrets - check out his [recent blog post and talk](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/2024-12-17-wasmclouds-fresh-approach-to-secrets) on the subject.

### Catch up…

{/* Add any blog posts/articles that the community might find interesting */}

- The [WasmCon](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbzoR-pLrL6o0UD4PoO0H_RnoToEiWBIS&feature=shared) + [KubeCon](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbzoR-pLrL6ofOuAJThKZIjxvFuB6B-el&feature=shared) session playlists are live on YouTube! Incredible examples of Wasm - and wasmCloud - being used in industry.
