### Meeting Notes
- **Welcome new community members!**
- Welcome Tyler Shoppe from Machine Metrics who is on Jochen Rau’s team. Tyler has been a community member for a while. Platform and backend stream processing in customer environments. Working with NATS for a long time, and now Wasm and wasmCloud. Taylor Thomas just [delivered a presentation](https://youtu.be/OTFQiMrG9lo?feature=shared) at Cloud Native Wasm Day on some of the work Tyler and Jochen's team has been doing. Great to see you on the call, Tyler!
- Welcome Siddharth Khonde! Has been in software engineering for 4 years. New to Wasm; started reading about wasmCloud start of this year and is passionate about contributing to wasmCloud open source. Great to meet you, Siddharth!

- **DISCUSSION: [wasmCloud 1.0](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/roadmap) update**
- We are very close! wRPC integration is almost done with some small things to finalize.
- Some host-tidying on bugs discovered during Wasm Day demos. Control topic changes etc.
- You can run this from main and have it work! We published the newly updated providers.
- Main thing remaining is Wadm, which is dependent on a number of smaller changes.
- Reason why we’re gating 1.0 on Wadm is because Wadm exercises the full multiple nodes in a lattice and tests in a real-world way. This will give us some performance guarantees.
- RCs will be toward the end of this week/beginning of next.
- We will add additional polish features after 1.0.

- **DISCUSSION: wasmCloud Operator**
- Dan Norris (Infrastructure Lead at Cosmonic): We open sourced the wasmCloud Operator at KubeCon last week.
- It’s a bit different in that it allows us to do 2 things:
    - Provision and manage a set of wasmCloud hosts in the same lattice: driven with a CRD. This brings all the replicas, lattice IDs, versioning you could wish for.
    - Natively integrated against Wadm so you can ‘kubectl apply’ a Wadm manifest. This makes running wasmCloud actors in Kubernetes really easy.
- Kick the tires with 0.82 host. Work with 1.0 when API is stabilized and we’ll let the community know when this happens.
- Integrates with Argo.
- Great on-ramp for those already running Kubernetes who want to start working with Wasm. Bridge to folks being able to use wasmCloud applications in existing environments.
- wasmCloud Wednesday live demo: Tune into the recording to see the wasmCloud Operator in action.
- Watch out for several new features coming through in the next few weeks. We’d also love to hear from you&mdash;if you have any feedback we want to hear it!

There was a much broader discussion around the ramifications of the wasmCloud Operator. Check out the recording below.

- **UPDATE: wasi-cloud**
- We are driving effort around wasi-cloud interfaces. Keep an eye on wasmCloud Slack and drop thoughts and ideas as they come through.
    - Runtime config - making 1 change.
    - Key-Value.
    - Blobstore.
    - Messaging.

- **UPDATE: Brand new OCI Specification**
- This will be a standard way of storing Wasm-based artifacts. Final vote 2 weeks from now, brought to Wasm Working Group April.

- **UPDATE: WASI and WASM SGs**
- 0.2.1 update due.
- Semantic versioned released for WASI are a focus for the ByteCode Alliance.

**Where we’ll be…**

**April 16 - 18** Taylor will present at [Open Source Summit NA](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/). Check out his talk: **[Mind the Gap Between the Future and the Present](https://ossna2024.sched.com/#)** taking place 16th April, 12:15pm - 12:55pm PT. If you’re going to be there, let him know.

**Listen in…**

Cloud Native Wasm Day [recordings](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2MQteKoXxICTWiUdZYEw6RI&feature=shared) are now live! Great to see the wasmCloud community on stage!
Bailey joined Matt Butcher and industry analyst Dustin Kirkland on theCube (SiliconAngle) during KubeCon + CloudNativeCon to talk all things WebAssembly, [take a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU4TVukPs8g).
Check out the [Arm Developer Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDTHXGuqXAI) where Bailey and Liam discussed the intersection of Wasm and GPU technologies.
Cosmonic CTO Bailey Hayes met Chris Matteson (Fermyon) and Oscar Spencer (F5 NGINX) on the panel at the [latest Kubernetes meetup in New York](https://www.meetup.com/new-york-kubernetes-meetup/events/297886914/). They explored the Wasm what’s, why’s, standards and considerations when adoption. [The recording is live!](https://youtu.be/ThcQNR-aVvI)
Listen in to the last [WasmEdge community meeting](https://youtu.be/ttiE7g2Ojuk) where Bailey Hayes talks all things WASI 0.2 and we hear from the students of the University of Tokyo on some cool new projects.
Bailey was a guest on a recent [Rancher Live podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPdzvL59tIA) with Divya Mohan. Tune in for a deep dive into WASI 0.2!
