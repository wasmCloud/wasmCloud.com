## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### Demo: Host update

Brooks shares an update to the wasmCloud host that supervises provider failures and demonstrates what this means. If a provider process is (for example) manually killed, the host will provide a warning-level error and restart the provider. There’s a bit of a conceptual shift here in putting this responsibility on the host.

Question: If a component is in the process of calling a provider when the provider is killed, what happens?
Brooks: This feature won’t help in that scenario, but it will make sure that the provider is there for the next invocation.

Question: What happens if the provider failure occurs in a scenario where a component calls set-link-name and calls a provider using a different target for the same interface, or a different config?
Brooks: The answer is pretty much the same here — all of the same links and configuration will be present once the provider is restarted, so the component will simply have to go through the call process again.

### Demo: Benchmarking 

Taylor updates on the progress of the wasmCloud benchmarking chart, with new options for waiting for tests to complete and outputting test results to ConfigMaps. Results are in a JSON array, so with this setup, users can flexibly do whatever they need to do with the results.

We’re in the process of securing CNCF infrastructure to support using this work for regular benchmarking on the project.

Question: Why are we looking for special infrastructure for this benchmark test?
Taylor: Because it’s big and chonky. More specifically, because we want to test in a production-like environment. It’s also stable, isolated infrastructure dedicated to the test, so you have a clean environment.

### Announcements

wash 0.38 is released, including fixes for wash dev, fetching WIT, colorizing text, outputting version information as JSON, automatically downloading new patch versions of wadm and wasmcloud when running `wash up`.

Notable new features in wasmcloud.toml files: 
* Expanded registry overrides
* Interface wildcard overrides

Question: Is this a step toward making wasmCloud more or less declarative?
Brooks: This feature basically enables you to give wash dev any missing information it might have — about a custom interface, say — and take advantage of the hot reload loop experience of wash dev while still using custom interfaces.

Question: Will this let you override default capabilities?

Brooks: Exactly - this is exactly what we’ll do in the quickstart, overriding the default usage of NATS-KV with Redis.

### Roadmap feature discussion 

We’re looking to consolidate `wash-cli` and `wash-lib` into one crate. This will be bigger refactor&mdash;if you’re thinking of taking a new issue on, make sure to check in with a maintainer and see how it might coordinate with this effort.
