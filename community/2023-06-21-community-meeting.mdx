### Meeting Notes

- DEMO: wasmCloud, Azure Webhooks, and auto-updating OCI URLs - Brooks
  - We had a problem with the observability of wasmCloud capability providers. In particular, official capability providers and example actors that we publish to Azure Container Registry.
  - The issue? Azure CR does not support unauthenticated dynamic content discovery so it's tricky to track versions.
  - We had a workaround - the Capability Provider Repo and shields.io badges. We've been using a dynamic json badge - using their API to provide a custom payload.
  - Issue: Readme in Github - markdown does not have ability to run customer code - no auto-update.
  - Last week we ran with an idea proposed by Jordan: capitalizing on the Azure Container Registry webhook - allows you to call version data after it pushes a new image version to Azure CR.
  - From here we can see the latest information and use the Key-Value contract to save this information in the KV store.
  - We also set up categories in order to fetch all the official capability provider data - name, OCI URL, actors.
  - This gives us a really useful way to make sure our capability providers are truly discoverable.
  - Next: use in wash to dynamically and automatically update the list of capability providers?
- DEMO: Interop between WebAssembly Components - Bailey
  - As the component model moves towards prime time, Bailey shows us a really powerful demonstration of how we can work across languages with components.
  - In the component model we have a new specification that defines how to cross language boundaries.
  - WASI Preview 2 experimental support for Wasm Components will land in wasmtime's v10.
  - In Bailey's demo, she shows that by taking the wit IDL and passing high level strings means we can work in a couple different languages.
  - Take a look at the recording to see the demo.
- DISCUSSION: Secrets in wasmCloud applications - All
  - We had a continuation of last week's lively discussion on secrets in wasmCloud apps. Key points (see the recording for the full discussion).
  - Taking a secret whether from an environment variable, app manifest or secret value to run within wasmCloud.
  - Important to differentiate between development environment and production-type environments when choosing secret stores.
  - Vault and variations - relative merits of ecosystem players.
  - wasmCloud not intended to be a secret store - plenty of good, established players.
  - Action: create a series of use cases for testing.
  - Action: Patrick will create a pre-RFC/RFC on secrets management based off of his infrastructure experience.
