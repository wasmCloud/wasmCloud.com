- DEMO: `wash get inventory --watch` and sorted outputs, thanks Aditya!
- DISCUSSION: Long live wash 0.31, welcome [wash 0.32](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/releases/tag/wash-cli-v0.32.0)

## Meeting Notes

### The `--watch` flag in wash

Brooks demonstrates the new `--watch` flag [Aditya](https://github.com/Aditya1404Sal) has added to watch the output of wash commands. This is already available for some commands like `wash app list` already, and Aditya is working on adding it to others like `wash get inventory`. This is configurable to specify update frequency (in milliseconds) with `--watch n`.

### Released wash 0.32

Short release notes for this one&mdash;a few minor improvements on the host side, while in on the wash side, fixes and additions to markdown output, colored output for clap, and an update to wash dev. 

### Discussion: Memory limits

We are planning to increase component memory limit to 256 MiB, default max component size to 50mb. This is currently configurable with `WASMCLOUD_MAX_LINEAR_MEMORY` environment variable.

We want to discuss the project's approach to memory limits in general. The challenge is that there are lots of different shapes and sizes of workloads - a Rust workload streaming gigabytes might not hit the old 10mb limit, but a simple workload in another language might hit it immediately.

* discussion of using [memory.grow](https://docs.rs/wasmtime/24.0.0/wasmtime/struct.PoolingAllocationConfig.html#method.max_memory_size)

* discussion of whether wastime allows overallocation - there is desire to avoid overallocation

Bailey reports that if configured with the Pooling Allocator, wasmtime does not allow overalloc. "The idea is that pools allocate with a big slab so you can amortize all of the vma operations in the kernel. Which matter with lots of parallelism. If you want dynamic management, this is a better fit https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/trait.ResourceLimiter.html"

### Preview: Packaging changes

Taylor previews `wkg` and updates to WIT package workflows using OCI artifacts. We'll see/discuss this at more length in the coming weeks.

## Community Updates

### Tune in…

wasmCloud Innovation Day is coming up on September 18! 

> Whether you’re already using Wasm or a complete newbie, this one-day virtual event is the ideal immersion in all things WebAssembly and wasmCloud. We’ll explore wasmCloud’s technical architecture and growing feature set—and most importantly, hear how companies in a host of industries are working with this popular open source CNCF project.

You can [register](https://wasmcloud.com/innovation-day) here.
