### DEMO: wasmCloud 1.2 / wash 0.31 showcase

- wasmCloud 1.2 is our latest release, now out! Check out this a great blog post on [wasmCloud 1.2](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/2024-08-27-wasmcloud-1.2-improved-streams-automatic-config-updates) which is well worth diving into.
- Highlights include: automatic config updates for providers (update to the latest SDK - there is a great first issue for implementing this in Go), improved streams, additional policy and secrets validation, better downstream link validation, and fully-tunable wasmtime runtime parameters (important to be able to control how much memory a component can use).
- In focus: `wasi-blobstore` streaming has seen a whole suite of improvements; manifests are better. Suggest checking out the blobby example to see how this is working in practice.
- This closes out all the remaining issues in the Q2 roadmap.
- In wash 0.31 we have a couple of great improvements - as always check out the recording for Brooks's demo.
- FEATURE: If you output the version for wash we now get the version and the embeded default versions of NATS wadm and wasmCloud that wash will utilize. This is super useful in the command line - easy to do wash// version and get all the versions needed by wash.
- FEATURE: improvements to the tables that we output in the command line. wash app lists - instead of having loads of separate fields, we hace the desc listed belwo the app and ave streamlined theinfo there.
- We have also updated the way we output to the terminal so we don't exceed the width of the terminal, which helps wth consistency.
- FEATURE: Thank you Aditya for enabling us to watch the status of wash app lists - instant refresh allows us to reconcile before compiling.
- FEATURE: We have a much improved wash status view. We can see a lot more info about the application and its inner state. When we query the wash app status, we can now see why it might not reconcile - infinitely more helpful.

### DISCUSSION: wasmCloud Q3 roadmap check-in

## Community Updates

### Tune in…

{/* Add any upcoming events/streams/etc */}

- Bailey will join Thomas Steiner on the Google Chrome Developers [WasmAssembly podcast](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcIA46I-YCX3ASF4SRb548z8s&feature=shared) with Thomas Steiner. Posting time TBC, catch up on Thomas's earlier discussions and [watch the wasmCloud Slack](https://wasmcloud.slack.com/) for more.

### Catch up…

{/* Add any blog posts/articles that the community might find interesting */}

- If you haven't caught up with [this episode of Cloud Native Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Q_Xx5i6Ek), we recommend taking a look. Adobe and Akamai prove the value of components vs containers, and show wasmCloud running distributed applications in multiple locations. In this case, watch Colin and Doug show wasmCloud running across the Akamai, AWS, and on-premise data centers. Kudos!

## Recording

{/* Automated - No need to adjust this unless automation fails */}
