## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### DEMO: wasmCloud 1.2 / wash 0.31 showcase

- wasmCloud 1.2 is our latest release, now out! Check out this a great blog post on [wasmCloud 1.2](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/2024-08-27-wasmcloud-1.2-improved-streams-automatic-config-updates) which is well worth diving into.
- Highlights include: automatic config updates for providers (update to the latest SDK - there is a great first issue for implementing this in Go), improved streams, additional policy and secrets validation, better downstream link validation, and fully-tunable wasmtime runtime parameters (important to be able to control how much memory a component can use).
- In focus: `wasi-blobstore` streaming has seen a whole suite of improvements; manifests are better. Suggest checking out the [blobby example](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/04d7e8e902ec27dcc20e1deeb222574554166ad1/examples/rust/components/blobby/README.md?plain=1#L4) to see how this works in practice.
- This closes out all the remaining issues in the Q2 roadmap.
- In wash 0.31 we have a couple of great improvements - as always check out the recording for Brooks's demo.
- FEATURE: If you output the version for wash we now get the version and the embeded default versions of NATS, wadm and wasmCloud that wash will utilize. This is super useful in the command line - easy to do wash version and get all the versions needed by wash.
- FEATURE: improvements to the tables that we output in the command line. wash app lists - instead of having many separate fields, we have the description listed below the app and have streamlined the information there.
- We have also updated the way we output to the terminal so we don't exceed the width of the terminal, which helps wth consistency.
- FEATURE: Thank you for your work [Aditya Salunkhe](https://github.com/Aditya1404Sal) in enabling us to watch the status of wash app lists - instant refresh allows us to reconcile before compiling.
- FEATURE: We have a much improved wash status view. We can see a lot more information about the application and its inner state. When we query the wash app status, we can now see why it might not reconcile - infinitely more helpful.

### DISCUSSION: wasmCloud Q3 roadmap check-in

- Thank you to the community for taking on a ton of issues! Exciting to see a growing number of you getting involved! The roadmap is a great place to start to find out our good first issues.
- And don't forget being a wasmCloud contributor means SWAG!
- The Q3 wasmCloud roadmap is always available to view [in the repo](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/roadmap/).
- We have 4 completed, 5 issues in progress and 6 ready for work.
- Improving CI, extensibility of wadm have landed already.
- In progress: thank you Massoud, for taking on the all-in-one helm chart.
- We have started on custom interface functions that use resources. Support for exporting a resource won't land in this feature but passing a resource around with custom interface functions is implemented today.
- Sharing components and providers between wadm manifests is progressing nicely.
- Working with [Ahmed Tadde](https://github.com/ahmedtadde) on [FEAT] emit application events on wadm topic - check out the link above for the full list of current issues and get involved!

### DISCUSSION: wasmCloud Innovation day, [sign up!](https://wasmcloud.com/innovation-day)

- Don't forget to sign up for [wasmCloud Innovation Day](https://wasmcloud.com/blog/2024-08-19-join-us-for-wasmcloud-innovation-day)! More details in this blog.

## Community Updates

### Tune in…

{/* Add any upcoming events/streams/etc */}

- Bailey will join Thomas Steiner on the Google Chrome Developers [WasmAssembly podcast](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcIA46I-YCX3ASF4SRb548z8s&feature=shared) with Thomas Steiner. Posting time TBC, catch up on Thomas's earlier discussions and [watch the wasmCloud Slack](https://wasmcloud.slack.com/) for more.

### Catch up…

{/* Add any blog posts/articles that the community might find interesting */}

- If you haven't caught up with [this episode of Cloud Native Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1Q_Xx5i6Ek), we recommend taking a look. Adobe and Akamai prove the value of components vs containers, and show wasmCloud running distributed applications in multiple locations. In this case, watch Colin and Doug show wasmCloud running across the Akamai, AWS, and on-premise data centers. Kudos!

## Recording

{/* Automated - No need to adjust this unless automation fails */}
