## Meeting Notes

### Demo: `wash capture` and `wash spy` - Taylor

- Wash 0.18 just launched (thanks, Brooks!).
- Wash Capture is a new command with an experimental flag.
- This creates a capture stream which sets up a sliding window capable of capturing the last 60 minutes.
- The potential this has to reduce the pain of debugging in wasmCloud projects is significant.
- Possible to set it up to capture your own invocations.
- Wash Spy on KV counter demo - see recording.
- The great thing is we can watch what's happening, clearly see incidents when they happen and remediate them in short order - we may even be able to see responses.
- If I have a bug and want to capture it, I can go wash capture which will grab all the messages and outputs to a local tarball - a wash capture file.
- A neat replay feature takes the capture file and plays through the host inventory.
- At this stage, you can filter per message or incident: take the sliding window, capture what it found, save for later.
- It's also possible to disable when done.
- Wash Spy and Wash Capture made it into 0.18. you can run them as long as you install the latest version and activate the experimental flag (`--experimental`).

### Demo: Wash Dev - Victor

- Another exciting experimental feature!
- In the same vein, Wash Dev is designed to promote a better developer process, experience and project 'debuggability'.
- The echo actor talks to an http service provider and echoes the request back to whomever sent it.
- Please note: see recording to see what it looks like when you don't put the experimental flag on.
- Works both for development on a single actor, or multiple actors.
- At start, it realises there is no host running and starts a wasmCloud instance which becomes reachable.
- Once it is reachable it starts the project build - built continuously.
- Regardless of the approach, everything is configurable - the process will wait until you make a change.
- Functionality starting an actor from file - use a local file path a URI. This is how Wash Dev works right now - it watches the file locally and kicks off rebuild which will change the generated file.
- Take a look at the recording for the full demo.
- This will stabilize with good community feedback - all comments welcome.

### Wash 0.18 with Washlib 0.9 - Brooks

- Release notes now available [on GitHub](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wash/releases/tag/v0.18.0).
- We will shortly develop a strategy to generate the release notes in a better way.
- Bigger features include:
  - Flattening some of our verbose subcommands, like `wash ctl link put` -> `wash link put`, `wash ctl get inventory` -> `wash get inventory`, etc.
  - Lots of improvements fixing some of the build and UX.
  - Wadm now runs by default with `wash up`.
  - Wash app subcommand is now fully functional.
  - Wash spy and capture both make it in with experimental flags.
  - Wash burritos! The wasmCloud host is more static and platform-independent.
  - Also updating some of the content and tutorials in [docs sites](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com-dev/pull/112).
- Community feedback is most welcome!

### Wash developer iteration loop turned security discussion - Brooks

- Jordan - Wash Spy and Capture will make life easier - dev mode seems cool but hasn't experimented much yet.
- Issue: wash is becoming powerful but is easy to misconfigure - security consideration.
  - wash is becoming a _very_ powerful tool. It can spy on NATS, move artifacts around, manage private keys, and from a security perspective it's becoming a possibly very vulnerable tool.
  - Would love to see wash implementing subcommands that promote security, like `wash systemkey` that gives you a key to lock down wash.
  - The fact that it runs in user-land makes it easy for a vulnerability to gain access.
  - Could consider something like `wash lockdown` to clean up local development environments.
- `wash up` provisioning seed keys should be considered when thinking of using `wash` to provision infrastructure.
- Consider reauthentication to access keys.
- There are a few different levels of security to tackle here.
  - Clean config, avoiding writing secret data to local folders.
  - Process isolation for wasmCloud.
  - Isolating NATS connections is the key to locking down a wasmCloud lattice.
- Being able to audit the nkey hierarchy would be really important for enterprise customers that are looking to trace to the source of development.
- If you're working on solutions in the key management space, please come join our [Slack](https://slack.wasmcloud.com). We'd love to collaborate on the management of keys!
  - Would like to see wash sat implementing some sub- commands that promote security.
