## Agenda

{/* Update before the start of the meeting with planned agenda items */}

- Quickstart reborn: a tour of our new and improved Quickstart guide
- componentize-py, why is it being removed from quickstart

{/* truncate */}

## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### New http-password-checker TypeScript example

- Victor demonstrated updates to the Typescript hello world example bringing it in line with ecosystem standards.
- Victor is also working on a password strength checker example that leverages the wider JS ecosystem. This fills a bit of a gap — haven’t been many references for this sort of usage until now. In the example, Victor uses a library called valibot to perform password strength validation.
- Showcases wasmcloud-secrets interface as well as using an external JS library.
- Example shows how to use rollup as a bundler to roll up the valibot dependency into our code and build into a component.
- Victor gives a demo of the component using `wash dev`, using to check password strength.

### New quickstart:

- `wash dev` makes it possible to have a really smooth developer experience, we want to foreground that and leverage it in the quickstart to provide the smoothest possible on ramp.
    - We’re using the Diataxis documentation guidelines, and particularly aiming to:
        - Ruthlessly minimize and avoid explanation when hands-on
        - Avoid options when possible
        - Use plain language

### Removing Python from quickstart:

- Different languages toolchains are more and less positioned to support the kind of onboarding experience we want to create, and that’s always going to be the case - maintainers get busy or there aren’t enough, component support is early or developing so rapidly.
- Right now the Python toolchain isn’t quite developed enough to support the experience we want, or to headline in the quickstart.
- It remains usable with wasmCloud so long as you can build a component.

### What's on?
- [WasmCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/wasmcon/program/schedule/) and [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/schedule/) are just a few weeks away and the schedules are live. WasmCon is replete with talks covering wasmCloud and its uses. Check out the [agenda](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/wasmcon/program/schedule/). It's so good to see so many of our community users sharing their stories. We're looking forward to seeing everyone there.
- The wasmCloud Project Booth will be open in the Project Pavilion on Wed 13, in the afternoon and evening during KubeCrawl! Come along for a chat, meet the maintainers, and learn about wasmCloud from the experts.
- If you're planning to be at [TechCrunch Disrupt](https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2024/) in SF, pop along to booth M11 where our own Liam Randall will be on hand to discuss all things WebAssembly and wasmCloud.

### Catch up!
- If you're planning to be in Salt Lake City for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA, [this podcast is a must-listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikm2aWsihto). SLC native Taylor Thomas + Rancher's Orlin Vasilev join forces on the Rancher by SUSE podcast to hear Taylor's top travel tips and what this year's KubeCon North America has in store!
