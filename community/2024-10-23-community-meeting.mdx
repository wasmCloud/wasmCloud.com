## Agenda

{/* Update before the start of the meeting with planned agenda items */}

- Quickstart reborn: a tour of our new and improved Quickstart guide
- componentize-py, why is it being removed from quickstart

{/* truncate */}

## Meeting Notes

{/* Add summary of topics during the meeting. Each Topic should have an H3 heading. A list is usually sufficient for the recap */}

### New http-password-checker TypeScript example

- Victor demonstrated updates to the Typescript hello world example bringing it in line with ecosystem standards.
- Victor is also working on a password strength checker example that leverages the wider JS ecosystem. This fills a bit of a gap — haven’t been many references for this sort of usage until now. In the example, Victor uses a library called valibot to perform password strength validation.
- Showcases wasmcloud-secrets interface as well as using an external JS library.
- Example shows how to use rollup as a bundler to roll up the valibot dependency into our code and build into a component.
- Victor gives a demo of the component using `wash dev`, using to check password strength

### New quickstart:

- `wash dev` makes it possible to have a really smooth developer experience, we want to foreground that and leverage it in the quickstart to provide the smoothest possible on ramp
    - We’re using the Diataxis documentation guidelines, and particularly aiming to:
        - Ruthlessly minimize and avoid explanation when hands-on
        - Avoid options when possible
        - Use plain language

### Removing Python from quickstart:

- Different languages toolchains are more and less positioned to support the kind of onboarding experience we want to create, and that’s always going to be the case - maintainers get busy or there aren’t enough, component support is early or developing so rapidly
- Right now the Python toolchain isn’t quite developed enough to support the experience we want, or to headline in the quickstart
- It remains usable with wasmCloud so long as you can build a component

## Recording

{/* Automated - No need to adjust this unless automation fails */}
