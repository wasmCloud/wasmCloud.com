**Time:** Wednesday, September 18, 2024 @ 10am - 6pm Eastern  
**Place:** Virtual

Whether you’re already using Wasm or a complete newbie, this one-day virtual event is the ideal immersion in all things WebAssembly and wasmCloud. We’ll explore wasmCloud’s technical architecture and growing feature set&mdash;and most importantly, hear how companies in a host of industries are working with this popular open source CNCF project.

Here’s what to expect…check out the full agenda below!

**wasmCloud in Industry:** Hear how engineers from the world’s largest organizations are using wasmCloud in real-world use cases.

**Technical Deep Dive:** wasmCloud has been transformed with WASI 0.2 and wasmCloud 1.1 is full of features designed to make building with components a joy. From secrets support to creating your own custom capabilities, we’ll take a deeper look at what’s new, and how to get the most out of 1.1.

**Community Workshop and Hangout:** Join us in Gather space to build your own Wasm application and hang with industry leaders, open source contributors, and wasmCloud users.
