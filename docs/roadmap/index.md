This roadmap page is a snapshot of the current state of the project. It is not a guarantee of future direction or features. It is a living document and will change as the project evolves. You can view the most current version of this roadmap on [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7/views/12).

The 2024 Q4 Roadmap was brainstormed and planned in the [09 Oct 2024 community meeting](/community/2024/10/09/community-meeting). Thank you to all who attended, commented, and contributed to making this roadmap community-driven.

## Retrospective

The [2024 Q3 roadmap](./2024-q3.md) primarily focused on continual improvement of the developer experience for writing wasmCloud applications. Focusing on an RFC for an improved `wash dev`, issues for native debugging support for components, and requests for more idiomatic language support, the Q3 roadmap sought to improve our core experience over large sweeping features.

Another (personal) goal for the Q3 roadmap was to ensure that at least half of the features on the roadmap were community contributed, and though not all features landed during the Q3 period, over half of the issues were assigned to community contributors!

## Goals

We're calling Q4 the polish quarter. With the upcoming KubeCon EU conference and a couple of issues still to land, wasmCloud is going to focus on holistic improvements across documentation, developer experience, testing, and troubleshooting. The foundation of wasmCloud 1.0 continues to hold strong for backwards compatible new releases, and we're still not seeing a need to introduce major breaking changes in order to enable development of Wasm applications. Given that, our goals will carry forward through Q4 2024.

1. **Utilize the transparency of components to provide a seamless developer experience for building, testing, and deploying applications with wasmCloud.**
1. Enable developers to build features without vendor lock-in, platform specific dependencies, or language constraints.
1. Facilitate 50% of issues on our Q3 roadmap to be completed by community contributors (non-wasmCloud maintainers)
1. Surface more information from internal APIs in wasmCloud, wadm, and the operator to improve debuggability

## Features

wasmCloud as a project offers the following top features:

1. Declarative WebAssembly Orchestration
1. Seamless Distributed Networking
1. Vendorless Application Components
1. Completely OTEL Observable
1. Defense-In-Depth Security By Default

## Diagram

This roadmap is unordered as each individual task can be completed indepedently, so no rigid order is necessary. The diagram is also not exhaustive, as there a few smaller tasks that are not included. This roadmap is also available as a [GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/projects/7/views/12) for consistent updating. Compared to previous roadmaps the community only planned this roadmap using the GitHub project.

## Contributing

We welcome all contributors to the wasmCloud project, and we'd love to have help to accomplish our goals. If you're interested in contributing, please see our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information, and come join us on [Slack](https://slack.wasmcloud.com) to chat with the team and other community members.

We try to mark issues that are good for new contributors with the [**good first issue**](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/contribute) label, so look out for those for well scoped issues that are a good place to start.

We also host [weekly community meetings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_6cm5hud8evuns4pe5ggu3h9qrs@group.calendar.google.com) that are open to all, where we can discuss aspects of the roadmap.
