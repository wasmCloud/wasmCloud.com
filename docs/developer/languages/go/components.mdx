# Building components with Go

The Go ecosystem provides developers with powerful options for building WebAssembly components. Go and the TinyGo fork provide a strong foundation for development:

* **TinyGo**: The fast-moving implementation of Go for embedded environments includes native compilation to components with WASI 0.2 support as of TinyGo 0.33. 
* **Go** has supported compilation to WebAssembly for years; we expect native WASI 0.2 support like that in TinyGo to land in the near future.

## Go-native tooling

There are a number of useful tools available as Go packages that streamline and simplify the Go development experience:

### `wasm-tools-go`

[`wasm-tools-go`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools-go) is a project hosted by the Bytecode Alliance that collects utilities such as `wit-bindgen-go`, which generates Go bindings for WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT) interfaces. 

### `component-sdk-go`

[The Go Component SDK](https://github.com/wasmCloud/component-sdk-go) is an optional, open source framework that simplifies the development of WebAssembly components targeting the wasmCloud host runtime. The SDK aims to provide a more idiomatic Go development experience for developers using WASI interfaces such as `wasi:http` or `wasi:logging`.

### `wadge`

[`wadge`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wadge) is a "bridging" framework that enables your native code to interact with WebAssembly component interfaces for purposes such as testing. `wadge` acts as a bridge between your Go toolchain and a WebAssembly runtime that makes interfaces “just work” when it's time to test your code. 

## Get started

In this walkthrough, we will create an HTTP server from scratch using the [Go component SDK](https://github.com/wasmCloud/component-sdk-go/), write a test for the application, and use `wadge` to run the test. This walkthrough requires:

* [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) 1.23.0+
* [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/) 0.33.0+
* [wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation) CLI 0.32.1+ for building and deploying components
  {/* TODO: Remove after https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/pull/3270 is released (est. wash-cli@v0.36.0) */}
* [`wasm-pkg-tools`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-pkg-tools) 0.7.4+ for WIT dependency management

### Step 1: Set up with `wash`

The wasmCloud Shell (`wash`) CLI helps developers build component-based applications that can be deployed with wasmCloud, and consolidates many open source component development tools. 

Create a new project called `http-test` and navigate into the project directory:

```shell
wash new component http-test --template-name hello-world-tinygo
```
```shell
cd http-test
```

Replace the contents of `world.wit` with the WIT definition below:

```wit
package example:http-server;

world hello {
  include wasmcloud:component-go/imports@0.1.0;

  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0;
}
```

Use the `wkg` cli tool to download the wit dependencies:

```shell
wkg wit fetch
```

Finally, we'll delete the contents of `hello.go` and write our HTTP server, which will return a simple "hello world."

Using the Component SDK, this looks like a fairly standard server using the HTTP standard library, with only a handful of exceptions where we use methods of `wasihttp` or `wasilog`.

```go
//go:generate go run github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools-go/cmd/wit-bindgen-go generate --world hello --out gen ./wit

package main

import (
	"net/http"

	"go.wasmcloud.dev/component/log/wasilog"
	"go.wasmcloud.dev/component/net/wasihttp"
)

func init() {
	wasihttp.HandleFunc(handler)
}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	logger := wasilog.ContextLogger("handler")

	logger.Info("request received", "host", r.Host, "path", r.URL.Path, "agent", r.Header.Get("User-Agent"))

	_, err := w.Write([]byte("hello world!"))
	if err != nil {
		logger.Error("failed to write body", "error", err)
	}
}

func main() {}
```

Add a `tools.go` file in your project so that the `wit-bindgen-go` tooling is able to generate the necessary bindings:
```shell
touch tools.go
```
```go
//go:build tools

package main

import (
	_ "github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools-go/cmd/wit-bindgen-go"
)
```

Download missing packages:

```shell
go mod tidy
```
Replace the contents of `wasmcloud.toml` with the configuration below:

```toml
name = "http-hello-world"
language = "tinygo"
type = "component"
version = "0.1.0"

[component]
wasm_target = "wasm32-wasi-preview2"
wit_world = "hello"
```

We also need a folder where the generated bindings will be stored:
```shell
mkdir gen
```

When we run `wash build`, we will generate bindings and compile a component:

```shell
wash build
```

The `wash inspect` subcommand enables us to examine the new component's imports and exports:

```shell
wash inspect --wit build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
```
```wit
package root:component;

world root {
  import wasi:clocks/monotonic-clock@0.2.0;
  import wasi:io/error@0.2.0;
  import wasi:io/streams@0.2.0;
  import wasi:http/types@0.2.0;
  import wasi:logging/logging;
  import wasi:cli/environment@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stdin@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stdout@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stderr@0.2.0;
  import wasi:clocks/wall-clock@0.2.0;
  import wasi:filesystem/types@0.2.0;
  import wasi:filesystem/preopens@0.2.0;
  import wasi:random/random@0.2.0;

  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0;
}
```

Now we can deploy on wasmCloud and try the component manually.

* Start wasmCloud locally (and in detached mode) with `wash up -d`
* Deploy with `wash app deploy wadm.yaml`. 

The `wadm.yaml` deployment manifest configures the application to run on localhost:8080.

Now we can `curl` the application and you should see the "hello world" response:

```console
$ curl localhost:8080
hello world!
```

### Step 2: Testing with a WASI interface

[`wadge`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wadge) is a "bridging" framework that will enable us to test our code using `go test` and standard test syntax.

Use `go get` to add `wadge` to the project:

```shell
go get go.wasmcloud.dev/wadge
```

Add a `tools.go` file to include the `wadge` bindgen:

```shell
touch tools.go
```

```go {diff} meta=tools.go
//go:build tools

package main

import (
	_ "github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools-go/cmd/wit-bindgen-go"
	_ "go.wasmcloud.dev/wadge/cmd/wadge-bindgen-go" // [!code ++]
)
```

Now we will write a test for the application in a new file called `hello_test.go`:

```shell
touch hello_test.go
```
```go
package main

import (
	"io"
	"log"
	"log/slog"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"testing"

	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
	incominghandler "go.wasmcloud.dev/component/gen/wasi/http/incoming-handler"
	"go.wasmcloud.dev/wadge"
	"go.wasmcloud.dev/wadge/wadgehttp"
)

func init() {
	log.SetFlags(0)
	slog.SetDefault(slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stderr, &slog.HandlerOptions{
		Level: slog.LevelDebug, ReplaceAttr: func(groups []string, a slog.Attr) slog.Attr {
			if a.Key == slog.TimeKey {
				return slog.Attr{}
			}
			return a
		},
	})))
}

func TestIncomingHandler(t *testing.T) {
	wadge.RunTest(t, func() {
		req, err := http.NewRequest("", "/", nil)
		if err != nil {
			t.Fatalf("failed to create new HTTP request: %s", err)
		}
		resp, err := wadgehttp.HandleIncomingRequest(incominghandler.Exports.Handle, req)
		if err != nil {
			t.Fatalf("failed to handle incoming HTTP request: %s", err)
		}
		assert.Equal(t, 200, resp.StatusCode)
		assert.Equal(t, http.Header{}, resp.Header)
		buf, err := io.ReadAll(resp.Body)
		if err != nil {
			t.Fatalf("failed to read HTTP response body: %s", err)
		}
		assert.Equal(t, []byte("hello world!"), buf)
	})
}
```
```shell
go mod download && go mod tidy
```
Generate `wadge` bindings for your test:

```shell
go run go.wasmcloud.dev/wadge/cmd/wadge-bindgen-go
```

This generates `bindings.wadge.go`.

Now run `go test`:

```shell
go test
```
```text
level=DEBUG msg="reading response body buffer"
level=DEBUG msg="read body stream chunk" buf="hello world!"
level=DEBUG msg="reading response body buffer"
level=DEBUG msg="response body closed"
PASS
ok  	github.com/wasmcloud/wasmcloud/examples/golang/components/http-hello-world	0.299s
```

To clean up, delete the application from your local wasmCloud and stop the host:

```shell
wash app delete tinygo-hello-world
```
```shell
wash down
```

### Reference: Set up without `wash`

`wash` simplifies set up for a Go project, but it is not required to build a Go-based component. For users who wish to use or understand the underlying tooling, the steps below replicate the initial set up above without `wash`.

Create a new Go project:

```shell
mkdir http-test && cd http-test
```
```shell
go mod init example/http/test
```
Now we'll add the Component SDK and `wasilog` packages to our project:

```shell
go get go.wasmcloud.dev/component go.wasmcloud.dev/component/log/wasilog 
```

Create a `/wit/` directory and a `world.wit` file:

```shell
mkdir wit && touch ./wit/world.wit
```
```wit
package example:http-server;

world hello {
  include wasmcloud:component/imports@0.2.0-draft;

  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0;
}
```

Add the `wasm-tools-go` package to a `tools.go` file in your project:

```shell
touch tools.go
```
```go
//go:build tools

package main

import (
	_ "github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools-go/cmd/wit-bindgen-go"
)
```

Then update your Go module:
```shell
go mod tidy
```

Finally, we'll write our HTTP server in a new `hello.go` file. Using the Component SDK, this looks like a standard server using the HTTP standard library.

```shell
touch hello.go
```
```go
//go:generate go run github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools-go/cmd/wit-bindgen-go generate --world hello --out gen ./wit

package main

import (
	"net/http"

	"go.wasmcloud.dev/component/log/wasilog"
	"go.wasmcloud.dev/component/net/wasihttp"
)

func init() {
	wasihttp.HandleFunc(handler)
}

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	logger := wasilog.ContextLogger("handler")

	logger.Info("request received", "host", r.Host, "path", r.URL.Path, "agent", r.Header.Get("User-Agent"))

	_, err := w.Write([]byte("hello world!"))
	if err != nil {
		logger.Error("failed to write body", "error", err)
	}
}

func main() {}
```
Now we'll generate Go bindings for the application's WIT interfaces.

```shell
mkdir gen
```
```shell
go generate
```
At this point, you can compile your Wasm component using `tinygo build`:

```shell
tinygo build --target=wasip2 --wit-package ./wit --wit-world hello
```
