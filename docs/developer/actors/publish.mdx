Once you're finished iterating on your actor component, you can publish it to any OCI compliant registry that supports artifacts. Throughout our examples and wasmCloud official artifacts we use [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com), AzureCR, and GitHub CR, but other registries should work as well. For local development and testing of the flow, refer to the [Running a local OCI registry](/docs/developer/workflow#running-a-local-oci-registry) section to run a local registry in a Docker container.

Once you have a registry available, you can use the [wash push](/docs/cli/push) and [wash pull](/docs/cli/pull) commands to push and pull actor components from OCI registries. For example, to pull a wasmCloud example locally:

```shell
wash pull wasmcloud.azurecr.io/hello:0.1.7
```

If you're working with an unauthenticated registry, you can directly push artifacts to it by specifying an image reference and the local file:

```shell
wash push localhost:5000/v2/wasmcloud/hello:0.1.7 ./hello.wasm
```

## Authenticated Registries
If you're working with an OCI registry that requires credentials, `wash` supports basic authentication via the `--username` and `--password` flags. Alternatively, you may opt to export your credentials as environment variables to avoid exposing them on the command line. This method of authentication works for both pushing and pulling.

```shell
export WASH_REG_USER=wasmcloud
export WASH_REG_PASSWORD=supersecret
wash push wasmcloud.azurecr.io/hello:0.1.7 ./hello.wasm
```

If your wasmCloud host is pulling from a registry that requires credentials, you can specify them when starting the host:
```shell
export OCI_REGISTRY=ghcr.io
export OCI_REGISTRY_USER=myusername
export OCI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=mys3cretper5onaltoken
wash up
```
