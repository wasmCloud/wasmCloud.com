This section describes how you can iteratively build and test your actor functionality.

## `wash dev`

As of wash 0.18.0 you can use the experimental `wash dev` command to rapidly build and iterate on
your actor.

`wash dev` starts a local wasmCloud host (if you don't already have one started), builds your actor,
and automatically registers your actor with the host. It will also watch your actor source code for
changes, recompile, and update the actor in the host.

This is a great way to get started with wasmCloud development, and we recommend it for all new
actors.

Currently, `wash dev` only will start the actor, so you'll have to follow the steps in the [running
the actor](./run) section to start the providers your actor needs. We hope to automate as much of
that away in the future.

Before running `wash dev`, you'll need to enable experimental mode for wash:

```shell
export WASH_EXPERIMENTAL=true
```

Then you can just run the `wash dev` command in the directory of your actor!

## Making modifications (Rust)

First install the crate we're using to parse the query string:

```shell
cargo add form_urlencoded
```

Our new actor has come pre-equipped with an http handler that generates a text string in the body of the response. By default, the text is "Hello World", and the greeting changes if the URL contains a name parameter. We will modify the business logic of the actor to select the greeting, using a second URL paramter. In this exercise, you will go through the process of editing code, recompiling, and updating the actor in a live running system.

The new parameter that selects the greeting will be called `msg`. If msg is "hello" (or if there is no msg parameter), the greeting will be "Hello NAME". If msg is "bye", the greeting will be 'Goodbye NAME', and so on.

```rust
    async fn handle_request(
        &self,
        _ctx: &Context,
        req: &HttpRequest,
    ) -> std::result::Result<HttpResponse, RpcError> {
        let name = form_urlencoded::parse(req.query_string.as_bytes())
            .find(|(n, _)| n == "name")
            .map(|(_, v)| v.to_string())
            .unwrap_or_else(|| "You".to_string());

        let msg_id = form_urlencoded::parse(req.query_string.as_bytes())
            .find(|(n, _)| n == "msg")
            .map(|(_, v)| v.to_string())
            .unwrap_or_else(|| "hello".to_string());

        let response = match msg_id.as_str() {
            "hello" => format!("Hello {}", name),
            "bye" => format!("Goodbye {}", name),
            "hey" => format!("Hey {}, what's up?", name),
            _ => format!("I didn't  understand that, {}", name),
        };

        Ok(HttpResponse {
            body: response.as_bytes().to_vec(),
            ..Default::default()
        })
    }
```

In `src/lib.rs`, replace handle_request with the code above. Since we aren't releasing a new version of the actor yet, we don't need to change the version number in `Cargo.toml`.

If you are using hot reloading, run `wash build` to build the actor and re-sign it. The host replaces all running instances of the actor with the new version, thanks to the hot reload feature, and re-links them with the HttpServer capability provider using the link parameters already provided. It is not necessary to re-issue a link command.

If you are using `wash dev`, wash will build and relaunch your actor for you

Let's try out the new actor:

```shell
curl 'localhost:8087/?name=Alice&msg=hello'
```

```shell
curl 'localhost:8087/?name=Bob&msg=bye'
```

```shell
curl 'localhost:8087/?name=Carol&msg=hey'
```

You've just completed a full development cycle of test, edit, recompile, run - all while the host continued running. If an actor is handling a message when an update occurs, the host waits for the message handler to complete, then swaps in the newer WebAssembly module before the next message is processed.
