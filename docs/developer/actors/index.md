To perform the steps in this guide, you'll need to have completed [installation](/docs/installation.mdx) of `wash`. You'll be able to pick your own language, or follow the "bring your own component" guide to create an actor in any language. For a conceptual overview of actors, see the [actor concepts](/docs/concepts/actors.mdx) documentation.

The following pages will take you through the process of creating a new actor:

- [Creating a new actor project](./generate)
