When you decide to create a new capability provider, you have two options:

- Create a provider for a brand new interface contract.
- Create a provider for an existing interface contract.

In this guide, we're going to cover all the steps for creating a capability provider, including creating a new interface. If you're not interested in defining interfaces and working with code generation, you can skip to the second step in this guide.

### The sample use case

For the purposes of this guide, we'll create a capability provider for a _payment service_ that accepts payments from customers.
When composing applications with actors and capabilities in an ecommerce setting, actors may have to accept payments from customers.
This, of course, requires access to the "outside world", but our actor can't even make network calls.

To solve this problem, we're going to hide the implementation details of payment approval behind the contract of a capability provider, giving us flexibility in the future to replace providers or reconfigure the implementation at runtime without any impact on running actors.

Creating a new capability provider involves:

1. [Creating an interface](../interfaces/creating-an-interface)
1. [Creating a new provider](./rust)
1. [Creating a provider archive](./create-par)
1. [Calling the provider from an actor](./consuming)
1. [Testing the new provider](./testing)
