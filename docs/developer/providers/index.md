Providers are executable host plug-ins&mdash;stateful, standalone processes that fulfill non-functional requirements for stateless components. For a high-level introduction to providers and why you might want to build one, see [Providers in the Concepts](/docs/1.0/concepts/providers) section.

Here, you can learn how to build your own provider. We'll walk you through implementing your own messaging provider for NATS, and you can use the same process to implement a capability provider using standard interfaces like `wasi:http`, `wasi:keyvalue`, `wasi:blobstore`, and `wasmcloud:messaging`.

We'll work through the following steps:

- [Create](./create): Create a new messaging provider from a template using `wash` and implement the `wasmcloud:messaging` interface.
- [Build](./build): Compile the provider artifact.
- [Test](./test): Test the provider in a local wasmCloud environment.
- [Publish](./publish): Publish the provider to an OCI registry.
