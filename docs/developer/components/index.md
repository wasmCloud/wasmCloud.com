To perform the steps in this guide, you'll need to have completed [installation](/docs/1.0/installation) of `wash`. You'll be able to pick your own language, or follow the "bring your own component" guide to develop a component in any language that supports Wasm components. For a conceptual overview of wasmCloud application components, see the [component concepts](/docs/1.0/concepts/components) documentation.

The following pages will take you through the process of developing application components:

- [Create](./generate)
- [Build](./build)
- [Run](./run)
- [Iterate](./update)
- [Publish](./publish)
