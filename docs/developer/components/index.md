To perform the steps in this guide, you'll need to have completed [installation](/docs/installation) of `wash`. You'll be able to pick your own language, or follow the "bring your own component" guide to develop a component in any language that supports Wasm components. For a conceptual overview of wasmCloud components, see the [component concepts](/docs/concepts/components) documentation.

The following pages will take you through the process of developing application components:

- [Create](/docs/developer/components/generate)
- [Build](/docs/developer/components/build)
- [Run](/docs/developer/components/run)
- [Configure](/docs/developer/components/configure)
- [Iterate](/docs/developer/components/update)
- [Publish](/docs/developer/components/publish)
