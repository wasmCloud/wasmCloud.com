The [`wash` CLI command](/docs/installation) includes a `build` subcommand that can be used to build [WebAssembly components](/docs/concepts/components).

:::info
See the [`wash build` CLI reference page](/docs/cli/wash#wash-build) for more information on available flags.
:::

The rest of this page will focus on practical examples of using the `wash build` command.

## Language support

Some languages (like Rust and Go) have support built-in to `wash`, while others require extra customization. A list of languages
with built-in support is published [in the `wasmcloud.toml` specification][wasmcloud-toml-spec].

Example projects written in languages with native support can be built by running:

```console
wash build
```

    <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust" default>

While you can always use the standard Rust toolchain and Bytecode Alliance tooling (like [`wkg`][wkg] for fetching WIT packages) to build your components,
`wash build`'s native support for Rust projects makes building components easier.

The `wash build` subcommand performs the same tasks as the following commands using tooling from the wider ecosystem:

```console
# Fetch wit dependencies (see https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-pkg-tools)
wkg wit fetch
# Build the WebAssembly component with the native Rust toolchain
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip2
# Sign the built WebAssembly component with your generated keys, using information in wasmcloud.toml
wash claims sign ./target/wasm32-wasip2/release/http_hello_world.wasm --destination http_hello_world_s.wasm
```

With native support for Rust implemented in `wash build`, the above simplifies to:

```console
wash build
```

While you can always use the standard Go and TinyGo toolchains and Bytecode Alliance tooling (like [`wkg`][wkg] for fetching WIT packages) to build your components,
`wash build`'s native support for Go projects makes building components easier.

The `wash build` subcommand performs the same tasks as the following commands using tooling from the wider ecosystem:

```console
# Fetch wit dependencies
wkg wit fetch
# Generate the types and bindings for the Wasm module
go generate
# Build the Wasm module
tinygo build -o ./build/module.wasm -target wasm32-wasi -scheduler none -no-debug .
# Embed the component wit metadata into the module
wasm-tools component embed wit ./build/module.wasm > ./build/embed.wasm
# Create a Wasm component from the embedded Wasm module by using the wasmtime adapter
wasm-tools component new ./build/embed.wasm -o ./build/component.wasm --adapt ./wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm
# Sign the Wasm component with your generated keys, using information in wasmcloud.toml
wash claims sign ./build/component.wasm --destination ./build/component_s.wasm
# Remove temporarily created files
rm ./build/embed.wasm ./build/module.wasm
```

With native support for Go implemented in `wash build`, the above simplifies to:

```console
wash build
```

    <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

In a TypeScript project, the `wash build` subcommand must be customized (via the [`[component]` section][config-reference-component] in [wasmcloud.toml][config-reference]) to use external JS-native tooling.

TypeScript builds require an installation of [NodeJS][nodejs] and [`npm`][npm]. After running `npm install`,
[`jco`][jco] (and [ComponentizeJS][componentize-js] underneath) can be used to compile the transpiled JavaScript code into a WebAssembly Component.

```toml
[component]
build_command = "npm run build"
```

An example `build` script in your `package.json` might look like the following:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "build:js": "tsc",
    "build:component": "jco componentize -w wit -o dist/your-component.wasm dist/your-component.js",
    "build": "npm run build:js && npm run build:component",
```

In our quickstart example, the `wash build` subcommand performs the same tasks as the following commands using tooling from the wider ecosystem:

```bash
# Fetch wit dependencies
wkg wit fetch
# You must run `npm install` first
npm install
# Transpile TypeScript code to JavaScript
tsc
# Componentize JavaScript code
jco componentize -w wit -o dist/index.wasm dist/index.js
# Sign the Wasm component with your generated keys, using information in wasmcloud.toml
wash build --sign-only --config-path wasmcloud.toml
```

    <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

In a Python project, the `wash build` subcommand must be customized (via the [`[component]` section][config-reference-component] in [`wasmcloud.toml`][config-reference]) to use external Python-native tooling.

Python builds require an installation of [Python](https://www.python.org/), [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) and [`componentize-py`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-py/)
(which can be installed with `pip`).

With Python ecosystem tooling in place, we can compile Python code into a WebAssembly Component. Modify the `[component]` section of
`wasmcloud.toml` to have the following `build_command`:

```toml
[component]
build_command = "componentize-py -d ./wit -w hello componentize app -o build/http_hello_world.wasm"
```

In our quickstart example, the `wash build` subcommand performs the same tasks as the following commands using tooling from the wider ecosystem:

```bash
# Fetch wit dependencies
wkg wit fetch
# Componentize Python code into a WebAssembly Component
componentize-py -d ./wit -w hello componentize app -o build/http_hello_world.wasm
# Sign the Wasm component with your generated keys, using information in wasmcloud.toml
wash build --sign-only --config-path wasmcloud.toml
```

    <TabItem value="unlisted" label="My Language Isn't Listed">

The `wash build` subcommand allows for building arbitrary languages into WebAssembly components via [configuring `wasmcloud.toml`][config-reference], for languages without built-in support.

For example, following the [Javascript ComponentizeJS example documentation](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/ComponentizeJS/blob/main/EXAMPLE.md), you can set up your `wasmcloud.toml` file like so:

```toml
name = "componentize-js"
language = "rust"
type = "component"

[component]
claims = ["wasmcloud:httpserver"]
build_command = "node componentize.mjs"
build_artifact = "hello.component.wasm"
destination = "hello_s.component.wasm"
```

Overriding the `build_command` allows you to use an external script or command to build the component, then specifying where the `build_artifact` is (wherever the component should be after the build command completes) lets `wash` still
sign the component using your generated keys and other configuration in `wasmcloud.toml`.

Note that running `wash build` with a custom `build_command` configured does not have full support for environment variables or multiple commands
and should be in the form of "command arg1 arg2 arg...". It's recommended to use a single external script to handle more complex build commands.

## Interface dependencies and `wash build`

When you run `wash build`, `wash` reads the specified world in your WIT files and downloads the appropriate dependencies automatically into the `wit/deps` directory. As such, in most cases you should add `wit/deps` to your `.gitignore` file and commit the generated `wasmcloud.lock` file.

Without any additional configuration, `wash` can download dependencies from the following namespaces (i.e. the `wasi` in `wasi:http@0.2.1`):

- `wasi`: Interfaces proposed for the common [WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) standard](https://wasi.dev/)
- `wasmcloud`: Interfaces maintained as part of the wasmCloud project (see the [Capability Catalog](/docs/capabilities/) to find first-party interfaces)
- `wrpc`: [Interfaces](/docs/reference/wasi/wrpc-interfaces) maintained as part of the WIT-over-RPC (wRPC) project
- `ba`: Interfaces maintained by the [Bytecode Alliance](https://bytecodealliance.org/)

In most cases, dependency fetching and management should be fairly straightforward! As your usage of Wasm grows, however, you are likely to use dependencies that are not in the above namespaces (such as internal registries or other remappings). Also, if you plan to publish any custom interfaces, you will need to configure your registry with credentials. For instructions on registry authentication, see the [Publish](./publish.mdx) page.

WIT interfaces are packaged and distributed as OCI artifacts. You can learn more about how the wasmCloud ecosystem uses OCI artifacts on the [Packaging](/docs/concepts/packaging.mdx) page.

### Migrating from `wit-deps`

Older versions of `wash` required a separate step using a `wit-deps` tool to download dependencies. This is no longer necessary with the newest versions of `wash`. To preserve backwards compatibility, if a `deps.toml` file is found in the `wit` directory of the project, `wash` will not fetch dependencies for you. To migrate to the new dependency management system, simply remove the `deps.toml` file and run `wash build` again. `wash build` will automatically remove all the old dependencies and download the new ones into your `wit/deps` directory.

:::warning
If you are using some of the provided wrpc interfaces like `wrpc:blobstore`, you will need to continue using `wit-deps`. This is due to an issue where some of the wrpc interfaces use syntax that is not yet available in the main WIT parser (but will be when WASI 0.3 is released) which causes the dependency resolution to fail.
