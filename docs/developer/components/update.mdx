This section describes how you can iteratively build and test your component functionality.

## wash dev

`wash dev` starts a local wasmCloud host (if you don't already have one started), builds your component, launches providers for well-known capabilities, and automatically registers your component with the host. It will also watch your component source code for
changes, recompile, and update the component in the host.

This is a great way to get started with wasmCloud development, and we recommend it for all new
components.

You can run the command with:

```bash
wash dev
```

The output should look like the following:

```bash
‚ö†Ô∏è   No running wasmcloud host detected (PID file missing), starting a new host...
üîß  Successfully started wasmCloud instance
‚è≥  Waiting for host to become reachable...
‚úÖ  Found single host w/ ID [NANYXG3E44U4PNBHROWR3KE6V6YK3AP6IJTZVOKH47MGHQJM7ICHG6HK]
üöß  Starting project build
‚úÖ successfully built project at [/Users/wasmcloud/hello/build/http-hello-world_s.wasm]
üëÄ watching for file changes (press Ctrl+c to stop)...
```

This will watch your project's files and, whenever there's a change, recompile and update the component in the host. Try iterating through a few changes in the [Add Features](/docs/tour/add-features/) section to see how it works.

If a component is handling a message when an update occurs, the host waits for the message handler to complete, then swaps in the newer WebAssembly component before the next message is processed.
