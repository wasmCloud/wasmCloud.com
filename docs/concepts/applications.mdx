## Overview

Applications combine all of the previous concepts into a declarative, deployable unit. wasmCloud supports the imperative management of [actors](./actors.mdx), [providers](./capabilities.mdx), and [links](./runtime-linking.mdx), which can be useful for experimentation or debuggging. However, these are generally considered low-level operations. wasmCloud supports complex distributed applications that can be dynamically adjusted at runtime, and managing a combination of actors, providers, links, and configuration one command at a time quickly becomes unwieldy.

Applications are the primary way to deploy workloads in a wasmCloud [lattice](./lattice.mdx). Applications are declarative, versioned, defined using a familiar syntax (YAML or JSON), and leverage an [existing manifest standard](https://oam.dev/). Define your app, hit "deploy", and wasmCloud will take care of the rest.

If you're familiar with Kubernetes or Nomad, you can think of a wasmCloud application as a Deployment or Job, respectively.

### Application Manifests

wasmCloud application manifests are composed of two sections: metadata and a `spec`. The metadata contains the application's name, version, and description. The `spec` contains a list of the application's components (actors and capability providers), each of which can have `traits`. Traits  define configuration for the component, links, and how the component should be deployed. Examples of deployment traits include:

- run a single instance on a specific host `foo`
- run `N` instances on each host in the lattice
- 80% on hosts with label `foo`, 20% on hosts with label `bar`

The following is an example of a simple wasmCloud application manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: echo
  annotations:
    version: v1.2.3
    description: My echo app
spec:
  components:
    - name: echo
      type: actor
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/echo:0.3.8
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 1
        - type: linkdef
          properties:
            target: httpserver
            values:
              address: 0.0.0.0:8080

    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        contract: wasmcloud:httpserver
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.19.1
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 1
```
