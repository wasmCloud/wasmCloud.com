## Overview

Applications combine all of the previous concepts into a declarative, deployable unit. 

Applications are the primary abstraction for deployable workloads in a wasmCloud [lattice](/docs/concepts/lattice). Applications are declared, versioned, and defined using **application manifests**. Manifests conform to the [OAM manifest standard](https://oam.dev/) and may be written in YAML or JSON. 

Once deployed, applications are represented as **models** in the **wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (Wadm)**. An application model may include multiple deployable versions. Model persistence is decoupled from deployments themselves and from any particular host.

If you're familiar with Kubernetes or Nomad, you can think of a wasmCloud application as a Deployment or Job, respectively.

### Application manifests

wasmCloud application manifests are composed of two sections: metadata and `spec`. 

* The metadata contains the application's name, version, and description. 
* The `spec` contains a list of the application's components and providers, each of which can have `traits`. Traits define configuration for the component, links, and how the component should be deployed. Examples of deployment traits include:

- run a single instance on a specific host `foo`
- run `N` instances on each host in the lattice
- 80% on hosts with label `foo`, 20% on hosts with label `bar`

The following is an example of a simple wasmCloud application manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: echo
  annotations:
    version: v1.2.3
    description: My echo app
spec:
  components:
    - name: echo
      type: component
      properties:
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/echo:0.3.8
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 1
        - type: linkdef
          properties:
            target: httpserver
            values:
              address: 0.0.0.0:8080

    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        contract: wasmcloud:httpserver
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.19.1
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 1
```

:::[Write less YAML]
The design of WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT) interfaces makes it possible to automate the generation of a manifest for a given component. Use the [`wit2wadm`](https://github.com/brooksmtownsend/wit2wadm) tool to quickly generate manifests from your components on the command line.

### wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (Wadm)

To deploy and manage applications, wasmcloud uses Wadm. Wadm uses a control loop to react to events and reconcile requested state with desired state.

For an in-depth guide into how how wasmCloud manages applications, see the [Wadm documentation](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/).

:::info[Imperative or declarative?]
While wasmCloud supports the imperative management of [components](/docs/concepts/components), [providers](/docs/concepts/providers), and [links](/docs/concepts/linking-components/) (which can be useful for experimentation or debuggging), these are generally considered low-level operations. Declarative application management is generally better-suited to complex distributed applications that can be dynamically adjusted at runtime.
:::

Application models are stored in a NATS key-value bucket and persist beyond a particular host. For more information on how Wadm handles models, see the [reference for the Wadm API](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/ecosystem/wadm/api).
