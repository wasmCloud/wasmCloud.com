## Overview

The actor model is a model of concurrent computation that's been around since
**1973** and is as meaningful and applicable today than it was 50 years ago.
In this model, the **actor** is the primitive building block
of concurrent computation.
Actors are "black-box" computational entities that can only communicate with
other actors by passing messages and creating new actors.

The academic definition of actors calls for them to be able to perform the following tasks _concurrently_:

* Send messages to other actors
* Create new actors
* Alter their own internal state
* Make local decisions
* Choose how to react to the next message

Implicit in this list is the rule that actors can't modify or directly read the state of other actors. The only way data is exchanged between entities in this system is through messages. There are a _ton_ of amazing resources on this concept, and if you're interested we highly recommend that you track down some of the references in the Wikipedia article.

**Note:** While it's possible to implement the actor model using these strict, academic
constraints, wasmCloud must temper them with some practical concerns that arise
from the need to manage **secure** and **resilient** distributed workloads.

## Stateless Actors
wasmCloud actors are **stateless**, allowing hundreds or thousands of copies
of an actor to be horizontally scaled across a cluster to meet compute demands.
When an actor needs state, it obtains it easily through the use of a capability provider.
By using capability providers, wasmCloud can ensure that no matter
which instance of an actor is invoked, or where it's running in the cluster,
it can still dynamically respond to the state of the larger application.

Providers like the [concordance](https://github.com/cosmonic/concordance) event sourcing provider create a developer experience that feels very much like internally stateful actors, while still optimized for distributed systems.

## Centralized Supervision
Actor supervision is a hallmark of the actor model. If you're used to systems like [Akka](https://akka.io/), where an application is one big supervision tree, and the only way to start an actor is from inside another actor, then wasmCloud's supervision model may seem awkward to you.

wasmCloud actors do not supervise other actors.
In a zero trust environment, allowing actors to spawn more is a security risk.
wasmCloud hosts maintain the horizontal scale of actors with an entirely flat hierarchy.

## Actor Components

An **_actor_ component** is the smallest unit of deployable, portable compute within the wasmCloud ecosystem. Actor components are small WebAssembly components that can handle messages delivered to them by the host runtime and can invoke functions on [capability providers](./capabilities), provided they have been granted the appropriate privileges.

## Single-Threaded

_Concurrency is hard_.
Even when we get concurrency correct, it's still hard. Building systems that work properly either through multi-threading or through so-called "green threads" or "coroutines" is difficult and error-prone. Concurrency and parallelism introduce friction in writing new code, maintaining old code, and troubleshooting applications. They routinely wreak havoc on production systems.

Developers want to write business logic without having to worry about the intricate details of the threading model of the surrounding environment. In alignment with [the actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model), wasmCloud actor componentss are single-threaded _internally_. The surrounding environment provided by the host runtime may have varying levels of concurrency support, or could even have entirely different concurrency models depending on whether it's running in a browser, on a constrained device, or in the cloud. The code we write for actor components should be oblivious to these things and, most importantly, _never have to change_ even if the surrounding environment adopts a different concurrency model.

While it's nice not worrying about the underlying concurrency model, it's important to understand that our single-threaded code has the potential to create bottlenecks. Therefore, when developing _message handlers_ for actor components, we need to embrace the design of performing small amounts of work in a "get in and get out fast" approach: divide the work to be done into the smallest bits possible, and perform each bit as fast as we can. This approach maximizes the benefits of _external concurrency_ while still keeping the code we write blissfully synchronous.

Again, these kinds of patterns occur in all actor systems, not just wasmCloud.

## Reactive

Actor components are [reactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming). An actor cannot initiate any action on its own, it can only _react_ to outside stimuli in the form of messages delivered by the host. Actor developers declare which messages their actor components handle as input and return messages as output. The following example implements a handler that receives a bank account query and responds with the bank account value:

```rust
#[async_trait]
impl BankServer for BankActor {
    async fn handle_inquiry(&self,
        ctx: &Context,
        query: &BalanceInquiry) -> RpcResult<Balance> {

        // queried using another capability provider
        let balance = get_balance()?;
        Ok(Balance{
            account: query.account,
            balance
        })
    }
}
```

While the preceding actor code could communicate with capability providers (e.g. a _key-value store_ to retrieve the account balance), it could only do so in response to a message being delivered from the host.

## Communication by Abstraction

wasmCloud actor components are _loosely coupled_ with the capability providers they use for non-functional requirements. An actor doesn't communicate with **Redis** or **Cassandra** or **Consul**, instead it communicates with a generalized abstraction over _key-value stores_. Under the hood, each of these abstractions is represented by a contract or **interface**. As long as the capability provider implements the correct interface contract, it should be considered compatible with your actor. An actor written against the key-value store abstraction should be able to work with _any_ key-value store, and even have that store swapped live at runtime without requiring a rebuild or redeploy.

There are a number of _first-party_ [interfaces](https://github.com/wasmcloud/interfaces) which we maintain in our Github organization. Additionally, the community can build their own public capability providers and enterprises are free to build their own internal, proprietary capability providers that expose private enterprise or corporate functionality.

## Secure

Actor components are secure by default. Because actor components are WebAssembly components that cannot use the WASI extensions, these modules are physically incapable of interacting with any operating system functionality on their own. The only way actor components can affect their external environment is through the use of a capability provider.

Actor components must be explicitly granted access to each capability provider contract (abstraction/interface), otherwise the host runtime will not allow it to make calls to that provider or receive messages from it. Granting access to capabilities is discussed more in the [security](/docs/deployment/security/env) section of the reference, but the short version is that each actor's WebAssembly components contains an embedded JSON Web Token (JWT) that holds claims, including claims attesting with which providers the actor is allowed to communicate.
