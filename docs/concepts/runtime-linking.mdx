## Overview

A **runtime link** is a declared connection from a component to a provider, a provider to a component, or a component to a component. Link definitions are unidirectional, having both a **source** and a **target**, and specifying the relevant WASI interfaces. 

From the [component's](/docs/1.0/concepts/components) point of view, code _only_ refers to an interface, e.g. `wasi-keyvalue`. This is because components do not know about (nor should they) _which_ specific provider is on the other side of a link. 

From a provider's point of view, it only ever dispatches messages to&mdash;or receives messages from&mdash;components. When a link is established for a particular component, the provider can remember that component's identity and use it for subsequent dispatches. As a result, the only information a provider needs is the component's identity. This identity is typically used for managing specific resources on behalf of the component, such as database connections, open TCP sockets, etc.

## Exploring a link definition

Runtime links are defined in [wadm manifests](/docs/1.0/ecosystem/wadm/). Here is an example of a definition for a link from a component to a provider:

```yaml
- type: link
  properties:
    target: kvredis
    namespace: wasi
    package: keyvalue
    interfaces:
      - atomic
      - eventual
    target_config:
      - name: redis-connect-local
        properties:
          URL: redis://127.0.0.1:6379
```
In addition to a target, the link definition has properties including...

* `namespace`, which in the example above refers to `wasi`
* `package`, which specifies the particular interface group used
* `interfaces`, which lists specific interfaces from `wasi-keyvalue` 
* `target_config`, defining configuration data to pass to a provider

### Designed for flexibility at runtime

Links are first-class citizens of a [lattice](/docs/1.0/concepts/lattice). A link can be declared (or removed) _before or after_ any of the parties of that link are running. Each time a provider is started, it is provided with a list of pre-existing links. Additionally, the provider is notified whenever a new link is declared, or an existing link is removed.

The ability to update links at runtime is a powerful feature of wasmCloud. There are several scenarios where this is useful, including:

- Swapping to an alternate capability provider implementation, such as an in-memory cache vs. an external data store.
- Upgrading a provider, or failing over to a backup provider.
- Routing requests to a provider running with specific characteristics, such as locality or configuration.

:::note
"Order of operations" doesn't matter in runtime linking: while configuring an [application](/docs/1.0/concepts/applications), low-level commands to set links and start resources can arrive in any order. Additionally, all providers must treat messages to set/remove links as idempotent.
