## Overview

A **_runtime link_** is a declared connection between a specific actor and a specific capability provider. Link definitions are a tuple composed of the actor's identity, the provider's identity, and a link name. (If not provided, link names default to `default`.) There are 3 different consumers of this relationship: 

* the actor
* the capability provider
* the host runtime

### From an Actor's Perspective

From the [actor's](./actors.mdx) point of view, code written using an interface _only_ refers to a [contract ID](./capabilities.mdx), e.g. `wasmcloud:keyvalue` (and optionally, a link name, e.g. `default`). This is because actors do not know about (nor should they) _which_ specific capability provider is responsible for fulfilling the contract. The choice of which provider satisfies a contract for an actor is a choice that is always made at _runtime_.

### From a Capability Provider's Perspective

From the capability provider's point of view, it only ever dispatches messages to actors or receives messages from actors. When a link is established for a particular actor, the capability provider can remember that actor's identity and use it for subsequent dispatches. As a result, the only information a capability provider needs is the actor's identity. This identity typically used for managing specific resources on behalf of the actor, such as database connections, open TCP sockets, etc.

### From the Host's Perspective

From the wasmCloud [host's](./hosts.mdx) point of view, it must know the following information when establishing a link between capability provider and an actor:

- The actor's identity. When a request is dispatched to an actor, the host receives the RPC message and passes it to the appropriate actor
- The contract ID (e.g. `wasmcloud:keyvalue` or `wasmcloud:httpserver`)
- The capability provider's identity. When an actor makes a request, the host handles dispatching the RPC message to the appropriate capability provider
- The link name of the capability provider, which is defined at provider start-time.

To illustrate the need for link names to disambiguate providers, consider the following scenario:

Assume that we have two capability providers in the lattice that implement the `wasmcloud:keyvalue` contract: a **Redis** capability provider with the link name `default`, an **in-memory cache** provider running with the link name `cache`, and a **Vault** key-value provider with the link name `secrets`. If the link connecting an actor and provider only contained the contract ID, the host runtime would not have enough information to determine where to route the actor's request.

### Designed for Flexibility at Runtime

Links are first-class citizens of a [lattice](./lattice.mdx). A link can be declared (or removed) _before or after_ any of the parties of that link are running. Each time a capability provider is started, it is provided with a list of pre-existing links. Additionally, the provider is notified whenever a new link is declared, or an existing link is removed.

The ability to update links at runtime is a powerful feature of wasmCloud. There are several scenarios where this is useful, including:

- swapping to an alternate capability provider implementation, such as an in-memory cache vs. an external data store
- upgrading a provider, or failing over to a backup provider
- routing requests to a provider running with specific characteristics, such as locality or configuration

:::note

This design has a couple interesting implications. The first is that "order of operations" does not matter: while configuring an [application](./applications.mdx), low-level commands to set links and start resources can arrive in any order. The second is that all capability providers must treat messages to set/remove links as idempotent.
