# Capabilities

A **_capability_** is an abstraction or representation of a non-functional requirement; some functionality required by your actor that is not considered part of the core business logic.

Some examples of non-functional requirements you might be familiar with:

- Sending notifications
- Fetching secret values
- Accessing Databases
- Serving content over HTTP

For example, when writing a web service that exposes a [RESTful API][restful-api], the HTTP server and the database are not parts of your business logic -- your primary concern is structuring your API so that users can easily get the data they need.

Non-functional requirements are services *used* by your actor to perform business logic. **We call these services "capabilities".**

[restful-api]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST

# Capability Contracts

Capability contracts specify the required functionality for a given capability -- forming an interface or service abstraction that actors can rely on.

Capability contracts are identified with IDs -- unique names that identify an interface or service abstraction.

Capbility contract IDs in wasmCloud contain a vendor ID prefix (the vendor that defines the _contract_, not necessarily a specific _implementation_).

For example, the following is a table of first-party capability contract IDs supported by wasmCloud:

- `wasmcloud:httpserver`
- `wasmcloud:httpclient`
- `wasmcloud:messaging`
- `wasmcloud:keyvalue`

In addition to on-lattice providers, some capability contracts have implementations that are built-in to the [wasmCloud host][host]:

- `wasmcloud:builtin:numbergen`
- `wasmcloud:builtin:logging`

The list of capability providers continues to grow. Please refer to these github links for more information:

- [capability-providers](https://github.com/wasmcloud/capability-providers/) - a list of supported capability providers
- [interfaces](https://github.com/wasmcloud/interfaces) - definitions of several api specifications, many of which are capability contracts
- [example providers](https://github.com/wasmCloud/examples/tree/main/provider) - additional sample code

Capability contracts (and their associated IDs) are open, and any organization is free to create implementations of them.

We believe a healthy wasmCloud ecosystem includes multiple implementations of capability contracts from multiple vendors, including those with `wasmcloud:`-prefixed IDs.

# Capability Providers

In wasmCloud, _capability providers_ are self-contained processes that implement a _capability contract_, which corresponds to a well-defined API.

Capability providers run on your wasmCloud lattice, and ensure that functionality depended on by actors is available.

## Securing Capability access

Not every actor should be able to access every capability provider. Securing and restricting communication between actors and providers is important to avoid actors gaining access to providers they should not have access to.

To contact a provider that implements a capability contract, an actor must be signed with a the appropriate capability contract ID.

For example, an actor signed with the contract ID `wasmcloud:keyvalue` will be able to access any `wasmcloud:keyvalue` capability providers running on-lattice.
