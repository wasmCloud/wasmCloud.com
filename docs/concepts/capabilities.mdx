## Overview

A ***capability** is a reusable, pluggable piece of functionality. Applications implement capabilities for common requirements like storing and retrieving data, accessing secrets, and more. Examples of capabilities include:

* Key-Value Storage for caching (think Redis)
* Messaging for persistent message (think Kafka)
* Blob Storage for long term data storage (think S3)
* Secrets for secret management (think Vault)
* HTTP Client for sending HTTP requests
* HTTP Server for receiving HTTP requests
* Logging

You can find a complete list of first-party capabilities in the [Capability Catalog](/docs/capabilities/index.mdx).

## How capabilities work

Capabilities are enacted by an **interface** and one or more swappable **capability providers**. A provider delivers a specific implementation of a given capability by communicating with other entities in the common tongue of a standard API. 

For example...

* The [Redis key-value storage provider](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/pkgs/container/keyvalue-redis) delivers the key-value capability to application components over the standard [`wasi:keyvalue`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-keyvalue/) API. 
* The team can use the same `wasi:keyvalue` functions&mdash;for example, `get`, `set`, `delete`, and `exists`&mdash;regardless of your intended capability provider.
* If the development team chooses to use Vault for key-value storage instead, they can swap out the Redis provider for the [Vault provider](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/pkgs/container/keyvalue-vault). 
* The Vault capability provider will deliver a different implementation of the same capability *over the same API*.  

## Creating your own capabilities

wasmCloud supports custom capabilities&mdash;use our provider SDKs for [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/wasmcloud-provider-sdk) and [Go](https://github.com/wasmCloud/provider-sdk-go) to create your own providers, and write your own interfaces in the [WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT)](/docs/concepts/interfaces) interface description language. For more information, see...

* [Creating a provider](/docs/developer/providers/)
* [Creating an interface](/docs/developer/interfaces/creating-an-interface)
