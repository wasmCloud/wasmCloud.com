## Overview

[WebAssembly components](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model) are the unit of compute for wasmCloud. Components are containers for WebAssembly modules (or other sub-components), which can depend on and expose interfaces. This aligns well with wasmCloud's approach to building distributed applications via the [actor model](/docs/concepts/actors) and [interface-driven development](/docs/concepts/interface-driven-development).

### Embracing Standards

The Component Model is an emerging standard for WebAssembly, and wasmCloud contributors and maintainers have been actively involved in helping make it a reality. wasmCloud believes that the Component Model is the future of WebAssembly and is committed to supporting a componentized ecosystem.

The wasmCloud host remains up-to-date with the latest versions of [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) and [WASI Preview 2](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/preview2/README.md), a set of interfaces designed to allow WebAssembly components to access external resources in a safe and portable way.

## WebAssembly Interface Types (WIT) Interfaces

Since one of the main benefits of WebAssembly components is *composition*, it's important to structure the composition and ensure that contracts on either side are fulfilled properly.

The [WebAssembly Interface Types (WIT) specification][wit-spec] was developed to make component composition manageable in a principled way.

WIT serves as a WebAssembly-native [Interface Definition Language (IDL)][wiki-idl] layer (think [gRPC][grpc], [Smithy][smithy]), that directs how components interact, which types are sent over the boundaries of WebAssembly components.

### Example: A `greeter` interface defined in WIT

WIT interfaces are developed in the open and are simple to understand and read:

```wit
package local:greeter-demo; // <namespace>:<package>

interface greet { // interface <name of interface>
  greet: func(name: string) -> string; // a function named "greet"
}

world greeter {
  export greet; // make the `greet` function available to other components/the runtime
}
```

While reading the [spec][wit-spec] is the best way to learn about WIT, it is also reasonably simple to understand at a glance.

How to *use* WIT in your WebAssembly components is beyond the scope of this document, but [`wit-bindgen`][wit-bindgen] is a great place to start if you are interested.

### Compare: WIT vs. gRPC

For those familiar with [gRPC][grpc], the above WIT interface would look something like the following:

```grpc
syntax = "proto3";

package greeter;

service Greeter {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
}

message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

Similar to gRPC, WIT defines both a schema and a method for serialization/movement across abstraction boundaries (via the Component Model).

:::warning
A key difference: while gRPC is meant to perform over network boundaries, WIT is *in-process*, and performs at near-native speed.
:::

### Compare: WIT vs. Smithy

For those familiar with [smithy][smithy], the above WIT interface would look something like the following:

```smithy
namespace com.example.greeter

service GreeterService {
    version: "2022-01-01",
    operations: [Greet]
}

operation Greet {
    input: GreetRequest,
    output: GreetResponse
}

structure GreetRequest {
    @required
    name: String
}

structure GreetResponse {
    // Required string field
    @required
    message: String
}
```

Similar to Smithy, WIT defines both a schema and a method for serialization/movement across abstraction boundaries (via the Component Model).
