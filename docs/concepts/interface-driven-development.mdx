## Overview

Interface Driven Development (**IDD**), aka contract-driven development, is a development approach that _focuses on defining **what** components need before **how** to meet those needs_.

Systems developed using IDD—especially distributed systems—are _more loosely coupled, robust and maintainable_.

By default, [WebAssembly components](/docs/concepts/webassembly-components) operate in a completely isolated sandbox, meaning that they can only perform logical operations with no access to system resources like I/O, networking, and syscalls.

In functional programming terminology we might call these modules "pure", as they can only map inputs to outputs without producing side-effects. 

But without any side-effects, how can we use WebAssembly components to do anything useful in our applications?

Interface driven development is the core that makes wasmCloud possible. 

### Separate Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

wasmCloud embraces interface driven development and separation of concerns in its design of [actors](/docs/concepts/actors) and [capability providers](/docs/concepts/capabilities). Actors implement the functional requirements of (part of) an application: compute a result, allow access, respond to requests, etc. Capability providers implement the non-functional requirements, such as connecting to a data store, serving HTTP requests, or sending a message to a queue. Actors and providers communicate through interfaces called capabilities.

### WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT)

wasmCloud uses [WIT](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md) as its IDL for interfaces. WIT is designed to allow WebAssembly components to define the interfaces they support ("exports") and the capabilities they need ("imports"). wasmCloud also uses WIT to define the interface/contract provided by capability providers.

wasmCloud is in the process of migrating interfaces from Smithy to WIT. If you see references to Smithy in the wasmCloud ecosytem, they are referring to the [stable ABI](/docs/hosts/abis/wasmbus/)
