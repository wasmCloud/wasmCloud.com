Interface Driven Development (**IDD**), aka contract-driven development,
is a development approach that _focuses on defining **what** components
need before **how** to meet those needs_.

**Systems developed using IDD - especially
distributed systems - are _more loosely coupled, robust and maintainable_.**

WebAssembly modules operate in a completely isolated sandbox, meaning
that they can only perform logical operations with no access to system
resources like I/O, networking and syscalls.

In functional programming terminology we might call these modules "pure",
as they can only map inputs to outputs without producing side-effects.
Without any side-effects, how can we use WebAssembly components to do anything
useful in our applications?

Interface (or contract) driven development is the core that makes wasmCloud possible.

In order to use isolated WebAssembly modules for useful work, we have to build
explicit paths in and out of the module and pass them as inputs.
These paths are defined using abstractions called _interfaces_ which specify
exactly what kinds of functions and data types the modules have access to.

These interfaces give our sandboxed WebAssembly components access to *external*
services:
- key-value stores
- HTTP servers & clients
- message brokers
- ... and much more

As you make your way through the concepts you'll see many
examples of interfaces and their implementations (called capability providers).
