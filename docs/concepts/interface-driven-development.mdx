## Overview

Interface Driven Development (**IDD**), aka contract-driven development, is a development approach that _focuses on defining **what** components need before **how** to meet those needs_.

Systems developed using IDD—especially distributed systems—are _more loosely coupled, robust and maintainable_.

By default, [WebAssembly components](/docs/concepts/webassembly-components) operate in a completely isolated sandbox, meaning that they can only perform logical operations with no access to system resources like I/O, networking, and syscalls.

In functional programming terminology we might call these modules "pure", as they can only map inputs to outputs without producing side-effects. 

But without any side-effects, how can we use WebAssembly components to do anything useful in our applications?

Interface driven development is the core that makes wasmCloud possible. 

### Separate Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

wasmCloud embraces interface driven development and separation of concerns in its design of [actors](/docs/concepts/actors) and [capability providers](/docs/concepts/capabilities). Actors implement the functional requirements of (part of) an application: compute a result, allow access, respond to requests, etc. Capability providers implement the non-functional requirements, such as connecting to a data store, serving HTTP requests, or sending a message to a queue. Actors and providers communicate through interfaces called capabilities.

### WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT)

wasmCloud uses [WIT][wit-spec] as its [Interface Definition Language (IDL)][wiki-idl] for interfaces (similar to [gRPC][grpc], [Smithy][smithy]). 

WIT is designed to allow WebAssembly components to define the interfaces they support ("exports") and the capabilities they need ("imports"). wasmCloud also uses WIT to define the interface/contract provided by capability providers.

wasmCloud is in the process of migrating interfaces from Smithy to WIT. If you see references to Smithy in the wasmCloud ecosytem, they are referring to the [stable ABI](/docs/hosts/abis/wasmbus/)

### Example: A `greeter` interface defined in WIT

WIT interfaces are developed in the open and are simple to understand and read:

```wit
package local:greeter-demo; // <namespace>:<package>

interface greet { // interface <name of interface>
  greet: func(name: string) -> string; // a function named "greet"
}

world greeter {
  export greet; // make the `greet` function available to other components/the runtime
}
```

While reading the [spec][wit-spec] is the best way to learn about WIT, it is also reasonably simple to understand at a glance.

How to *use* WIT in your WebAssembly components is beyond the scope of this document, but [`wit-bindgen`][wit-bindgen] is a great place to start if you are interested.

### Compare: WIT vs. gRPC

For those familiar with [gRPC][grpc], the above WIT interface would look something like the following:

```grpc
syntax = "proto3";

package greeter;

service Greeter {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
}

message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

Similar to gRPC, WIT defines both a schema and a method for serialization/movement across abstraction boundaries (via the Component Model).

:::warning

A key difference: while gRPC is meant to perform over network boundaries, WIT is *in-process*, and performs at near-native speed.

### Compare: WIT vs. Smithy

For those familiar with [smithy][smithy], the above WIT interface would look something like the following:

```smithy
namespace com.example.greeter

service GreeterService {
    version: "2022-01-01",
    operations: [Greet]
}

operation Greet {
    input: GreetRequest,
    output: GreetResponse
}

structure GreetRequest {
    @required
    name: String
}

structure GreetResponse {
    // Required string field
    @required
    message: String
}
```

Similar to Smithy, WIT defines both a schema and a method for serialization/movement across abstraction boundaries (via the Component Model).
