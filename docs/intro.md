# What is wasmCloud?

wasmCloud is a **universal application platform** that helps you build and run globally distributed WebAssembly applications on any cloud and any edge.

Our goal is to make development more joyful and efficient by giving developers the tools to write only the code that matters&mdash;and making it easy to run that code anywhere.

wasmCloud leverages WebAssembly's security, portability, and performance to compose applications from tiny, independent building blocks.

These building blocks are managed declaratively and reconfigurable at runtime. You shouldn't need to recompile your whole app to upgrade a database client or patch a vulnerability. You shouldn't need to recompile _anything_ to move your app from development to production.

wasmCloud is designed around the following core tenets:

- Distributed from day one
- Run anywhere and everywhere
- Secure by default
- Faster iteration and lower maintenance

**Move from concept to production without changing your design, architecture, or your programming environment.**
