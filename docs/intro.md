# Welcome

wasmCloud helps you build globally distributed applications that reach from the cloud to the edge. Leveraging WebAssembly's security, portability, and performance, the platform helps you compose applications from tiny, independent building blocks loosely coupled to capabilities.

Deciding whether you're building a serverless function, a microservice, a globally distributed app, or a monolith is now a knob you can turn at runtime rather than a one-time decision you're stuck with until your application retires.

Get started building applications with wasmCloud today and enjoy the freedom of only having to write the code that matters.

wasmCloud is designed around the following core tenets:

- Dead simple Distributed Applications
- Run anywhere
- Secure by default
- Save time, money, and effort
- Productivity for both Developers and Operations

You should not have to change your design, architecture, or your programming environment as you move from concept to production.

**We're bringing bring _joy_ to building global-scale applications.**
