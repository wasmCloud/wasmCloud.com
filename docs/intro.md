# What is wasmCloud?

wasmCloud helps you build globally distributed applications that reach from the cloud to the edge.

By leveraging WebAssembly's security, portability, and performance, wasmCloud helps compose applications from tiny, independent building blocks loosely coupled to capabilities.

Deciding whether you're building a serverless function, a microservice, a globally distributed app, or a monolith is now a knob you can turn at runtime rather than a one-time decision you're stuck with until your application retires.

Get started building applications with wasmCloud today and enjoy the freedom of only having to write the code that matters.

wasmCloud is designed around the following core tenets:

- Dead simple distributed applications
- Run anywhere
- Secure by default
- Productivity for both developers and operations

**Move from concept to production without changing your design, architecture, or your programming environment.**
