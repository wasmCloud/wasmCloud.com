The wasmCloud documentation site is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com) and built with [Docusarus](https://docusaurus.io/).

Choosing a [`good first issue`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) is a great way to get started. 

## Running the site locally

```bash
npm ci
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service. It's a good idea build in order to check for errors like broken links that may prevent a successful deployment. 

## Serving static content

To serve the generated static content:

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Generating CLI documentation

The [command-line documentation](/docs/cli/wash) at [`docs/cli/wash.mdx`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud.com/tree/main/docs/cli/wash) is generated using the `--help-markdown` argument with `wash`. An easy way to run the command is `wash app list --help-markdown > help.md`. Once you've generated CLI documentation, copy the contents to the `index.mdx` file linked above.

## Making a pull request

See the [Pull Request](/docs/contributing/contributing-guide#pull-requests) section of the Contributing Guide. Note that a `--signoff` argument is required with your commits.
