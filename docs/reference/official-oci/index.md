We maintain all officially supported, continually updated, first-party images managed by the wasmCloud team on GitHub repositories.

You can find a complete list of the most up-to-date versions and OCI images for all first-party wasmCloud providers on [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/wasmCloud/packages?repo_name=wasmCloud). The list includes:

- `blobstore-fs`
- `blobstore-s3`
- `http-server`
- `http-client`
- `keyvalue-redis`
- `keyvalue-vault`
- `messaging-nats`
- `messaging-kafka`

The code for providers is maintained [in the wasmCloud repository](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates/). Refer to the [examples directory](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples) for the latest updated versions of our example components and providers.
