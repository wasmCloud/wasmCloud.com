wasmCloud works well in secure environments, including those with private networks, proxies, and private registries. This guide provides information on how to configure wasmCloud to work in these environments.

## Proxies

The wasmCloud host supports pulling images for [components](/docs/concepts/components) and [providers](/docs/concepts/providers) from [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) (Open Container Initiative) registries.

See the [Proxies](./proxies) guide for information on how to configure wasmCloud to work through a proxy.

## Registries

The wasmCloud host can be configured to authenticate with a private registry using [host configuration](/docs/reference/host-config).

See the [Registries](./registries) guide for information on how to configure wasmCloud to work with private registries.

## Certificates

wasmCloud, by default, will use the native system certificates when attempting to establish secure connections.

See the [Certificates](./certificates) guide for information on how to configure wasmCloud to use custom certificates.
