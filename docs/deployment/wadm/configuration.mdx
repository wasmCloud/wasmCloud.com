:::info
These guides are for deploying `wadm` in **production**. For local development and testing, simply run `wash up`. For more information on `wadm`, see the [`wadm` docs](/docs/category/declarative-application-deployment-wadm).

### Preconfiguring Storage

:::warning
The following is important to avoid data loss in production!
:::

`wadm` uses two NATS [Key Value buckets](https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/developer/develop_jetstream/kv) for storage: application manifests, and lattice state.

#### Application manifests

The manifests bucket contains the "source of truth" for `wadm` applications. **If the manifest storage is lost, all knowledge of applications is gone**. For production deployments, we highly recommend preconfiguring this bucket with multiple replicas and taking backups regularly.

For example, to configure the manifests bucket with 3 replicas:

```bash
nats kv add wadm_manifests --history=1 --replicas=3 --storage=file
```

:::info
The default bucket name is `wadm_manifests`. If you use another name, you will need to set the `--manifest-bucket-name` flag
:::

#### Lattice state

If the state bucket is lost, `wadm` will self-heal and recover state over the next couple of minutes, as hosts report their state via events.


### Configuration Options

`wadm` is configured via command line flags or environment variables. The following configuration options are supported:

| Option                       | Environment Variable        | Description                                                                                                                                                               | Default Value                      |
