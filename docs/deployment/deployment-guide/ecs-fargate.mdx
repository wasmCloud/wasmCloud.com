## Overview

This deployment guide demonstrates how to deploy wasmCloud using [Amazon's Elastic Container Service (ECS) Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html) service. 

To follow this guide, you will need an [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) account.

## Install tools

This guide uses the [**Terraform CLI**](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) and a local installation of the [**wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)** CLI](/docs/installation.mdx)

### Install Terraform CLI

On macOS, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install the Terraform CLI:

```shell
brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
```

On Windows, you can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to install the Terraform CLI:

```shell
choco install terraform
```
Note that **we recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** to run `wash` on Windows, and you may wish to use the Linux instructions instead.

For installation on Linux distributions, see the [documentation for Terraform CLI installation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).

### Install `wash`

Once wasmCloud is deployed to ECS Fargate, you can use the **wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)** CLI to manage wasmCloud applications. If you do not have `wash` installed locally, follow the instructions below.

On macOS, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install `wash`:

```shell
brew install wasmcloud/wasmcloud/wash
```

On Ubuntu and Debian Linux, you can use `apt` to install `wash`:

```shell
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/wasmcloud/core/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
```

```shell
sudo apt install wash
```

We recommend using **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** to run `wash` on Windows. 

You can find more information about Windows installs&mdash;as well as other package managers and the option to install from source&mdash;on the [installation page](/docs/installation).

Verify that `wash` is installed by running:

```shell
wash --version
```

## Instance requirements

Below are the required elements of a wasmCloud deployment on ECS Fargate:

- 1x NATS instance
  - Public Load Balancer exposing port 4222 (`wash` access)
  - Ephemeral Volume for Jetstream
- 1x wasmCloud wadm instance
- 1x wasmCloud worker instance
  - Autoscaling based on CPU usage
  - Capacity: 1 min, 1 max (configurable)
- 1x wasmCloud ingress instance
  - Public Load Balancer exposing port 80 (`http` access)

## Deploy wasmCloud with Terraform

Download the Terraform files from the `deploy/ecs-fargate` directory in the [wasmCloud community contributions](https://github.com/wasmCloud/contrib) repository. 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wasmcloud/contrib.git
```
```shell
cd deploy/ecs-fargate
```

Create a file named `terraform.tvfars` with the following content:

```hcl
aws_region              = "us-east-2"

# If using aws cli profile (SSO), set it here
aws_profile             = "enterprise-dev"

# CIDRs for wash access ( default none )
nats_allowed_cidrs      = ["XX.XX.XX.XX/XX"]

# CIDRs for http access ( default 0.0.0/0 )
wasmcloud_allowed_cidrs = ["XX.XX.XX.XX/XX"]
```

Replace the X's in the `nats_allowed_cidrs` and `wasmcloud_allowed_cidrs` fields with your local CIDR block to allow connection with your local `wash` via NATS (as well as HTTP access). 

:::warning[Security note]
The permissiveness of allowed CIDRs is an important security consideration and should be evaluated carefully to minimize vulnerability.
:::

Apply the Terraform configuration:

```shell
terraform init
```
```shell
terraform apply
```

## Manage wasmCloud with `wash`

Create an environment variable connecting your local `wash` CLI to your deployed wasmCloud host:

```shell
export WASMCLOUD_CTL_HOST="$(terraform output -raw nats_lb)"
```
Test `wash` connectivity:

```shell
wash get inventory
```

## Deploy and access applications

Once `wash` is set up, deploy a sample application from the `wasmcloud-on-ecs-fargate` directory:

```shell
wash app deploy ./hello-world-wadm.yaml
```

To access the application, create an environment variable connecting your local `wash` CLI to the wasmCloud endpoint:

```shell
export WASMCLOUD_LB="$(terraform output -raw wasmcloud_public_lb)"
```
Test the application:

```shell
curl -i http://$WASMCLOUD_LB
```
