wasmCloud is **compatible with, but not dependent on**, Kubernetes. We think the future of WebAssembly is bright, _and_ we also know there are plenty of systems already running in Kubernetes. For this reason, we provide the wasmCloud operator to help users run wasmCloud hosts on a Kubernetes cluster&mdash;and thereby run WebAssembly components on Kubernetes.

For high-level discussion of our approach to Kubernetes and compatibility with common cloud native tooling, see [wasmCloud on Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes/).

On **this** page, you can find documentation for operators wishing to deploy wasmCloud with Kubernetes, including details on prerequisites such as NATS and how to deploy the operator.

:::info[kubectl support]
When running wasmCloud on Kubernetes, you can use `kubectl` to deploy [wasmCloud manifests](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/model), check wasmCloud logs, and more. The example below demonstrates standard usage of `kubectl` with wasmCloud.
:::

## Getting started with the wasmCloud operator

The wasmCloud operator can be found on GitHub at [https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator) and enables...

1. Deployment of wasmCloud Hosts onto a Kubernetes cluster via Custom Resource Definition (`WasmCloudHostConfig`)
2. Interoperability with the [wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (wadm)](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/) for deploying wasmcloud applications defined in the [OAM spec](https://oam.dev/) format.
3. Automated creation of Kubernetes Services pointing to wasmCloud applications deployed with a HTTP Server capability (in the future this will become configurable&mdash;today it's automatic).

In order to follow the instructions on this page, you will need a Kubernetes cluster and appropriate access credentials as well as a [Helm](https://helm.sh/) installation. It will also be useful to have [wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)](/docs/installation) installed locally.

You can watch a [video of the setup on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/embed/239Q_hAKqPw?si=y0nHeFHfCPOdItNU&start=235&end=780):

### Deploying the operator

A wasmCloud cluster requires a few things to run:

- A **[NATS](/docs/ecosystem/nats/) cluster** (with Jetstream enabled)
- **[wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (wadm)](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/)** connected to the NATS cluster in order to support deploying wasmCloud applications

If you are running Kubernetes locally, the following steps will help you start a NATS cluster and wadm in your Kubernetes cluster, then deploy the operator.

:::info[Testing]
Make sure you have a Kubernetes cluster running locally. Some good options include [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/), [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), [k3s](https://k3s.io/), or [k0s](https://k0sproject.io/).
:::

#### Deploy NATS

Add the NATS Helm repo:

```shell
helm repo add nats https://nats-io.github.io/k8s/helm/charts/
```

Install the upstream NATS Helm chart to start a cluster with the `values.yaml` file from the quickstart:

```shell
helm upgrade --install -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/nats-values.yaml nats nats/nats
```

Validate the installation with:

```shell
kubectl rollout status deploy,sts -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=nats
```

#### Deploy wadm

You can deploy wadm to your Kubernetes cluster with a Helm chart hosted by wasmCloud.

```shell
helm install wadm -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/wadm-values.yaml oci://ghcr.io/wasmcloud/charts/wadm
```

Validate the installation with:

```shell
kubectl rollout status deploy -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=wadm
```

#### Deploy the operator

To deploy the operator:

```shell
kubectl apply -k https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/deploy/base
```

Validate the installation with:

```shell
# make sure pods are ready
kubectl rollout status deploy -l app=wasmcloud-operator -n wasmcloud-operator
# apiservice should be available
kubectl get apiservices.apiregistration.k8s.io v1beta1.core.oam.dev
```

### Create wasmCloud hosts

Apply the `wasmcloud-host` manifest:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/wasmcloud-host.yaml
```

Check wasmCloud host status:

```shell
kubectl describe wasmcloudhostconfig wasmcloud-host
```

You can also check logs for a given host with:

```shell
kubectl logs -f -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-wasmcloud-cluster -c wasmcloud-host
```

### Deploying a workload

When you `kubectl apply` a [wasmCloud application manifest](../../ecosystem/wadm/model.md), the cluster will automatically provision the component workload with wasmCloud. Below is the `hello-world-application.yaml` manifest included in the quickstart:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.1

      type: component
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/components/http-hello-world-rust:0.1.0
      traits:
        # Govern the spread/scheduling of the component

        # Establish a unidirectional link from this http server provider (the "source")

        #
        # The source (this provider) is configured such that the HTTP server listens on 127.0.0.1:8080
        - type: link
          properties:
            target: http-component
            namespace: wasi
            package: http
            interfaces: [incoming-handler]
            source_config:
              - name: default-http
                properties:
                  address: 0.0.0.0:8080
```

Run `kubectl apply`:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator/main/examples/quickstart/hello-world-application.yaml
```

Check the deployment status:

```shell
kubectl get application
```

```shell
APPLICATION   DEPLOYED VERSION   LATEST VERSION   STATUS
hello-world   v0.0.1             v0.0.1           Deployed
```

### Manage applications with wash

Port-forward into the NATS service running in your Kubernetes cluster. `4222` is the port for the NATS service, `4223` is the port for NATS websockets.

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/nats 4222:4222 4223:4223
```

Now you can connect to wasmCloud on Kubernetes with your local wash toolchain:

```shell
wash app list
```

### Optional configuration

#### Image pull secrets (Optional)

You can also specify an image pull secret to use use with the wasmCloud hosts so that they can pull components from a private registry. This secret needs to be in the same namespace as the WasmCloudHostConfig CRD and must be a
`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` type secret. See the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#registry-secret-existing-credentials) for more information on how to provision that secret.

Once it is created, you can reference an image pull secret in the `WasmCloudHostConfig` CRD by
setting the `registryCredentialsSecret` field to the name of the secret.

#### Argo CD Health Check (Optional)

Argo CD provides a way to define a [custom health check](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/health/#custom-health-checks) that it then runs against a given resource to determine whether or not the resource is in healthy state.

For this purpose, we specifically expose a `status.phase` field, which exposes the underlying status information from wadm.

With the following ConfigMap, a custom health check can be added to an existing
Argo CD installation for tracking the health of wadm applications.

```yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
  namespace: argocd
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-cm
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: argocd

  resource.customizations: |
    core.oam.dev/Application:
      health.lua: |
        hs = {}
        hs.status = "Progressing"
        hs.message = "Reconciling application state"
        if obj.status ~= nil and obj.status.phase ~= nil then
          if obj.status.phase == "Deployed" then
            hs.status = "Healthy"
            hs.message = "Application is ready"
          end
          if obj.status.phase == "Reconciling" then
            hs.status = "Progressing"
            hs.message = "Application has been deployed"
          end
          if obj.status.phase == "Failed" then
            hs.status = "Degraded"
            hs.message = "Application failed to deploy"
          end
          if obj.status.phase == "Undeployed" then
            hs.status = "Suspended"
            hs.message = "Application is undeployed"
          end
        end
        return hs
```
