wasmCloud is **compatible with, but not dependent on**, Kubernetes. We think the future of WebAssembly is bright, _and_ we also know there are plenty of systems already running in Kubernetes. For this reason, we provide the wasmCloud operator to help users run wasmCloud hosts on a Kubernetes cluster&mdash;and thereby run WebAssembly components on Kubernetes.

For high-level discussion of our approach to Kubernetes and compatibility with common cloud native tooling, see [wasmCloud on Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes/).

On **this** page, you can find documentation for operators wishing to deploy wasmCloud with Kubernetes, including details on prerequisites such as NATS and how to deploy the operator.

:::info[kubectl support]
When running wasmCloud on Kubernetes, you can use `kubectl` to deploy [wasmCloud manifests](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/model), check wasmCloud logs, and more. The example below demonstrates standard usage of `kubectl` with wasmCloud.
:::

## Getting started with the wasmCloud operator

The wasmCloud operator can be found on GitHub at [https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator). It uses custom resource definitions (CRDs) to define wasmCloud hosts as Kubernetes resources.

In order to follow the instructions on this page, you will need a Kubernetes cluster and appropriate access credentials as well as a [Helm](https://helm.sh/) installation. It will also be useful to have [wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)](/docs/installation) installed locally. 

### Deploying the operator

A wasmCloud cluster requires a few things to run:

- A **[NATS](/docs/ecosystem/nats/) cluster** (with Jetstream enabled)
- **[wasmCloud Application Deployment Manager (wadm)](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/)** connected to the NATS cluster in order to support deploying wasmCloud applications

If you are running Kubernetes locally, the following steps will help you start a NATS cluster and wadm in your Kubernetes cluster, then deploy the operator.

:::info[Testing]
Make sure you have a Kubernetes cluster running locally. Some good options include [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/), [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), [k3s](https://k3s.io/), or [k0s](https://k0sproject.io/).
:::

#### Deploying NATS

Add the NATS Helm repo:

```shell
helm repo add nats https://nats-io.github.io/k8s/helm/charts/
```

Install the upstream NATS Helm chart to start a cluster with the following
`values.yaml` file:

```yaml
config:
  cluster:
    enabled: true
    replicas: 3
  leafnodes:
    enabled: true
  jetstream:
    enabled: true
    fileStore:
      pvc:
        size: 5Gi
    merge:
      domain: default
```

```shell
helm upgrade --install -f values.yaml nats-cluster nats/nats
```

#### Deploying wadm

You can deploy wadm to your Kubernetes cluster with a Helm chart hosted by wasmCloud. Use this `values.yaml` file to define a minimal deployment that connects with the NATS server deployed above: 

```yaml
wadm:
  config:
    nats:
      server: "nats-cluster.default.svc.cluster.local:4222"
```

Run `helm install`:

```shell
helm install wadm -f values.yaml oci://ghcr.io/wasmcloud/charts/wadm
```

#### Start the operator

To download and deploy the operator:

```shell
helm install wasmcloud-operator oci://ghcr.io/wasmcloud/charts/wasmcloud-operator
```

:::info[Secrets required]
The operator will fail to provision a wasmCloud deployment without the configuration below.
:::

#### WasmCloudHostConfig Custom Resource Definition (CRD)

The `WasmCloudHostConfig` CRD describes the desired state of a set of wasmCloud hosts connected to the same lattice. We will use `wash` to generate a public key and seed for the new wasmCloud hosts that will run on our Kubernetes cluster:

```shell
wash keys gen cluster

Public Key: <your key>
Seed: <your seed>

Remember that the seed is private, treat it as a secret.
```

Now we'll create a new manifest called `config.yaml` as below, adding the public key generated above under the `issuers` field:

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.wasmcloud.dev/v1alpha1
kind: WasmCloudHostConfig
metadata:
  name: my-wasmcloud-cluster
spec:
  # The number of wasmCloud host pods to run
  hostReplicas: 2
  # The cluster issuers to use for each host
  issuers:
    # This needs to be the public key of a cluster seed generated by
    # `wash keys gen cluster`
    - <public-key>
  # The lattice to connect the hosts to
  lattice: 83a5b52e-17cf-4080-bac8-f844099f142e
  # Additional labels to apply to the host other than the defaults set in the operator
  hostLabels:
    some-label: value
  # The address to connect to nats 
  natsAddress: nats://nats-cluster.default.svc.cluster.local
  # Which wasmCloud version to use
  version: 1.0.2
  # The name of a secret in the same namespace that provides the required secrets.
  secretName: my-wasmcloud-cluster
  # Enable the following to run the wasmCloud hosts as a DaemonSet
  #daemonset: true
  # The name of the image pull secret to use with wasmCloud hosts so that they
  # can authenticate to a private registry to pull components.
  # registryCredentialsSecret: my-registry-secret
```
```shell
kubectl apply -f config.yaml
```

Next we will create a manifest called `secret.yaml` for our secret, adding the seed generated above in the `WASMCLOUD_CLUSTER_SEED` field:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-wasmcloud-cluster
stringData:
  # You can generate this with wash:
  # `wash keys gen cluster`
  WASMCLOUD_CLUSTER_SEED: <seed>
#data:
  # Only required if using a NATS creds file
  # nats.creds: <creds file>
```
```shell
kubectl apply -f secret.yaml
```

You can confirm that your wasmCloud hosts have launched by checking logs for a given host with:

```shell
kubectl logs my-wasmcloud-cluster-xyz -c wasmcloud-host
```
(You can find your wasmCloud host pod's name with `kubectl get pods`.)

### Deploying a workload

When you `kubectl apply` a wasmCloud manifest, the cluster will automatically provision the component workload with wasmCloud. The example below uses a "hello world" manifest saved to a file called `wadm.yaml`:

```yaml
# Metadata
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  annotations:
    version: v0.0.1
    description: 'HTTP hello world demo'
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        # Your manifest deploys from a local .wasm file, but you can also use OCR registries as below
        image: wasmcloud.azurecr.io/http-hello-world:0.1.0
      traits:
        # One replica of this component will run
        - type: daemonscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 1
    # The httpserver capability provider, started from the official wasmCloud OCI artifact
    - name: httpserver
      type: capability
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/http-server:0.20.0
      traits:
        # Link the HTTP server and set it to listen on the local machine's port 8080
        - type: link
          properties:
            target: http-component
            namespace: wasi
            package: http
            interfaces: [incoming-handler]
            source_config:
              - name: default-http
                properties:
                  ADDRESS: 127.0.0.1:8080

```

Run `kubectl apply`:

```shell
kubectl apply -f wadm.yaml
application/hello-world created
```

Check the deployment status:

```shell
kubectl get application
APPLICATION   DEPLOYED VERSION   LATEST VERSION   STATUS
hello-world   v0.0.1             v0.0.1           Deployed
```

Port-forward from your local machine to the NATS service running in your Kubernetes cluster:

```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/nats-cluster 4222
```
Now you can connect to wasmCloud on Kubernetes with your local wash toolchain:

```shell
wash get inventory
```

### Optional configuration

#### Image pull secrets (Optional)

You can also specify an image pull secret to use use with the wasmCloud hosts so that they can pull components from a private registry. This secret needs to be in the same namespace as the WasmCloudHostConfig CRD and must be a
`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` type secret. See the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#registry-secret-existing-credentials) for more information on how to provision that secret.

Once it is created, you can reference an image pull secret in the `WasmCloudHostConfig` CRD by
setting the `registryCredentialsSecret` field to the name of the secret.

#### Argo CD Health Check (Optional)

Argo CD provides a way to define a [custom health check](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/health/#custom-health-checks) that it then runs against a given resource to determine whether or not the resource is in healthy state.

For this purpose, we specifically expose a `status.phase` field, which exposes the underlying status information from wadm.

With the following ConfigMap, a custom health check can be added to an existing
Argo CD installation for tracking the health of wadm applications.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: argocd-cm
  namespace: argocd
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: argocd-cm
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: argocd
data:
  resource.customizations: |
    core.oam.dev/Application:
      health.lua: |
        hs = {}
        hs.status = "Progressing"
        hs.message = "Reconciling application state"
        if obj.status ~= nil and obj.status.phase ~= nil then
          if obj.status.phase == "Deployed" then
            hs.status = "Healthy"
            hs.message = "Application is ready"
          end
          if obj.status.phase == "Reconciling" then
            hs.status = "Progressing"
            hs.message = "Application has been deployed"
          end
          if obj.status.phase == "Failed" then
            hs.status = "Degraded"
            hs.message = "Application failed to deploy"
          end
          if obj.status.phase == "Undeployed" then
            hs.status = "Suspended"
            hs.message = "Application is undeployed"
          end
        end
        return hs
```
