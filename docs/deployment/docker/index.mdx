### Release Artifacts

wasmCloud host and CLI releases are published to:
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/wasmcloud/wasmcloud)
- [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/wasmcloud/wasmCloud/pkgs/container/wasmcloud)
- Azure Container Registry (as `wasmcloud.azurecr.io/wasmcloud/wasmcloud`)

### Docker Compose

Deploying a minimal wasmCloud lattice with Docker Compose is straightforward. Consider using the [docker-compose-full.yml](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/examples/docker/docker-compose-full.yml) example—which includes a NATS server, host, and observability tooling—as a starting point. Note, however, **this example is not suitable as-is for production use**, as it uses anonymous authentication for all its components.
