wasmCloud hosts will always enforce a certain level of security by default that _cannot be loosened_. For example, hosts will always validate [runtime links](/docs/developer/debugging/components#missing-runtime-links). Additionally, the wasmCloud **policy service API** can be used to extend and customize policy evaluation, such as by restricting untrusted application components and providers on particular hosts.

### Policy evaluation flow

The policy service API provides a simple mechanism for communicating with an external policy server. External servers can be created using standard engines such as **[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)**.

Once the wasmCloud policy service is enabled, the host will send policy requests on a dedicated NATS subject (for example, `wasmcloud.policy`) to the external server. The policy server, in turn, returns responses on the same NATS subject, determining whether the host is allowed to start an application component, start a capability provider, or let a component invoke a capability provider.

**The policy service is disabled by default**. When enabled, the policy service will be called by a host when:

- a particular component or provider is started for the first time
- an invocation is received between two entities for the first time

The policy service evaluates the provided action and returns a response indicating whether it is permitted. This response is cached by the host, so subsequent requests for the same action will not incur any overhead.

### Policy Requests and Responses

Policy requests are made on a NATS subject, which is specified by the `--policy-topic` [host config](/docs/reference/host-config) option.

<summary>Policy request schemas</summary>

Request schemes vary according to whether the request is to start an application component, start a provider component, or perform an invocation.

**Schema for component start**:

```json
{
  "requestId": "... unique ID used for correlation ...",
  "kind": "startComponent",
  "version": "v1",
  "request": {
    "componentId": "componentId",
    "imageRef": "... OCI or file reference ...",
    "maxInstances": 1,
    "annotations": {
      "key": "value"
    },
    "claims": {
      "publicKey": "Mxxx",
      "issuer": "Axxx",
      "issuedAt": "1711993586",
      "expiresAt": 1711993587,
      "expired": true
    }
  },
  "host": {
    "publicKey": "Nxxxx",
    "lattice": "default",
    "labels": {
      "key": "value"
    }
  }
}
```

**Schema for provider start**:

```json
{
  "requestId": "... unique ID used for correlation ...",
  "kind": "startProvider",
  "version": "v1",
  "request": {
    "providerId": "component ID",
    "imageRef": "... OCI or file reference ...",
    "annotations": {
      "key": "value"
    },
    "claims": {
      "publicKey": "Vxxx",
      "issuer": "Axxx",
      "issuedAt": "1711993586",
      "expiresAt": 1711993587,
      "expired": true
    }
  },
  "host": {
    "publicKey": "Nxxxx",
    "lattice": "default",
    "labels": {
      "key": "value"
    }
  }
}
```

**Schema for invocation**:

For example, invoking a component on the WASI HTTP standard handler `wasi:http/incoming-handler.handle`:

```json
{
  "requestId": "... unique ID used for correlation ...",
  "kind": "performInvocation",
  "version": "v1",
  "request": {
    "interface": "wasi:http/incoming-handler",
    "function": "handle",
    "target": {
      "componentId": "componentId",
      "imageRef": "... OCI or file reference ...",
      "maxInstances": 1,
      "annotations": {
        "key": "value"
      }
    },
    "claims": {
      "publicKey": "Mxxx",
      "issuer": "Axxx",
      "issuedAt": "1711993586",
      "expiresAt": 1711993587,
      "expired": true
    }
  },
  "host": {
    "publicKey": "Nxxxx",
    "lattice": "default",
    "labels": {
      "key": "value"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

Note that in all requests claims are optional and may be omitted if the component is not signed. This is a useful check for a policy server to determine whether a component is signed by a trusted issuer.

```json

  "permitted": true|false,
  "message": "... optional detailed message ..."
}
```

### Revoking Policy Decisions

Past policy decisions can be revoked/overridden by the policy service by publishing on the `--policy-changes-topic` NATS subject.

### Example: Open Policy Agent

Since the policy service API is over NATS, it can be implemented by anything that can subscribe and publish responses to the configured policy topic (including a wasmCloud component!).

An example policy service implementing Open Policy Agent is [available in the wasmCloud GitHub repository](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples/security).
