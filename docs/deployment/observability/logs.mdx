wasmCloud hosts emit logs in plaintext by default. In a production environment, however, it's more common to emit logs in a structured format and aggregate logs from all hosts in a centralized location.

### Log Levels

The wasmCloud host supports the following log levels:
- `error`
- `warn`
- `info` (default)
- `debug`
- `trace`

To override the log level, use the `--log-level` [host config](/docs/reference/host-config) argument.

Take care when enabling `trace` or `debug` level logs in a production environment. These log levels may contain sensitive information.

### Stderr

Like many other cloud-native systems, the wasmCloud host emits logs to stderr. One advantage of this choice is that stderr is unbuffered, so logs will be streamed continuously.

### Structured Logs

To enable structured log output, use the `--enable-structured-logging` [host config](/docs/reference/host-config) argument. This will cause the host to emit logs as JSON, which are suitable for forwarding to a log aggregator.
