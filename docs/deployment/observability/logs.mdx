In addition to host-level logging, wasmCloud supports log exports using the [OpenTelemetry (OTEL)](https://opentelemetry.io/) specification.

For more information on wasmCloud's implementation of OpenTelemetry, including advanced configuration options, see [Observability with OpenTelemetry](/docs/deployment/observability/observability-with-opentelemetry.mdx).

### Configuration

By default, wasmCloud hosts write `info` level logs to `stderr` in plaintext. 

Enable the wasmCloud host to emit logs as an OTEL signal with the `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` environment variable:

```bash
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp
```

In v0.82, this enables all supported OTEL signals&mdash;not just traces. (A more accurately descriptive environment variable and command line argument is to come in v1.0.) 

Enabling OTEL signals automatically structures logs for OTEL export. (In this case, local `stderr` logs remain plaintext.)

wasmCloud hosts export structured logs via HTTP/OpenTelemetry Protocol (`otlp`) on port 4318.

The endpoint for exports may be overwritten with the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable:

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://my-custom-host:4318
```

These configurations can also be set with the `--otel-traces-exporter` and `--otel-exporter-otlp-endpoint` [host config](/docs/reference/host-config) options.

### Log levels

The wasmCloud host supports the following log levels:
- `error`
- `warn`
- `info` (default)
- `debug`
- `trace`

To override the log level, use the `--log-level` [host config](/docs/reference/host-config) argument.

:::warning

Take care when enabling `trace` or `debug` level logs in a production environment. These log levels may contain sensitive information.

### Structured logs

In a production environment, it's more common to emit logs in a structured format and aggregate logs from all hosts in a centralized location. Enabling OTEL signals automatically structures JSON logs for OTEL export, while local `stderr` logs remain plaintext.

To enable structured log output *without* enabling OTEL signals, use the `--enable-structured-logging` [host config](/docs/reference/host-config) argument. This will cause the host to emit logs as JSON, which are suitable for forwarding to a log aggregator.

```json
{"timestamp":"2024-01-09T17:54:59.113161Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"wasmCloud host started","host_id":"NDBYMWNPI3GSXBNM6H4WG6JTVB7K42KQWPOPICMIBVUXQL36ISJZHK4D"},"target":"wasmcloud_host::wasmbus"}
```

### Viewing logs with Grafana and Loki

A set of sample configurations and Docker Compose files are available to help launch a local observability environment. After following the instructions to [**launch a wasmCloud observability ecosystem**](/docs/deployment/observability/observability-with-opentelemetry#launch-a-wasmcloud-observability-ecosystem), you can navigate to [http://localhost:5050/explore](http://localhost:5050/explore), click the dropdown in the upper left, and select **"Loki"** to view logs.

Refer to the `OTEL_` environment variables in the [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/examples/docker/docker-compose-otel.yml) for a complete example configuration. The example uses Grafana and Loki, but wasmCloud works with any OTEL-compatible backend.
