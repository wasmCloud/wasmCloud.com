wasmCloud is designed to support cloud native observability standards using [OpenTelemetry (OTEL)](https://opentelemetry.io/). OpenTelemetry is an open source project defining common APIs and standards for telemetry in cloud native systems. As of v0.82.0, wasmCloud emits **traces** and **logs** as OTEL [**signals**](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/), with **metrics** support slated for v1.0.

### Data flow

A wasmCloud observability ecosystem must include an [**OTEL collector**](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/), a vendor-agnostic application from the OpenTelemetry project that processes and routes signals. The wasmCloud host emits signals to the OTEL collector, which passes the data on to observability systems such as [**Grafana**](https://github.com/grafana/grafana). 

![wasmcloud host -> otel collector -> system like Grafana](../../images/otel-diagram.png)

The OTEL documentation provides detailed instructions on how to [install and run the OTEL collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/quick-start/). Additionally, you can find a [sample configuration for an OTEL collector](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/examples/docker/otel-collector.yaml) in the wasmCloud observability ecosystem demo on GitHub.

While the OTEL collector is the recommended point of configuration for complex signal routing, there are a set of core configurations available at the level of a [wasmCloud host](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/concepts/hosts).

### Configuration

Enable the wasmCloud host to emit OTEL signals with the `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` environment variable:

```bash
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp
```

In v0.82, this enables all supported OTEL signals at once&mdash;not just traces. (A more accurately descriptive environment variable and command line argument is to come in v1.0.)  

By default, OTEL signals are exported on port 4318, the standard **HTTP/OpenTelemetry Protocol (`otlp`)** port. wasmCloud only supports the `otlp` format. The endpoint for `otlp` exports may be overwritten with the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable:

```bash
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://my-custom-host:4318
```

While these options are typically passed as part of [host configuration](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/reference/host-config), you can launch a wasmCloud observability ecosystem locally by passing environment variables to `wash up`:

```bash
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp wash up
```

### Launch a wasmCloud observability ecosystem

A set of sample configurations and Docker Compose files are available on GitHub. These samples can be used to launch an example wasmCloud observability ecosystem. Clone or download the wasmCloud repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud.git`
```

Change directory to `examples/docker`:

```bash
cd wasmcloud/examples/docker
```

Run the `docker-compose-otel.yml` file to launch...

- **Grafana** for dashboards
- **The OTEL collector** for ingesting OTLP signals from the wasmcloud host
- **Tempo** for processing traces and passing them to Grafana
- **Loki** for processing logs and passing them to Grafana
- **Prometheus** for metrics (wasmCloud metrics support still in development)

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-otel.yml up
```

Make sure a wasmCloud host is running locally with OTEL signals enabled:

```bash
OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp wash up
```

Now you can access Grafana's "Explore" interface at [http://localhost:5050/explore](http://localhost:5050/explore).

### Advanced options

Because wasmCloud's implementation of OpenTelemetry observability uses upstream OTEL libraries, a variety of advanced configuration options are available via environment variables defined in the upstream [OTEL SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/) and [OTLP Exporter SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter/). 

For example, users have several options for [trace sampling](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/#general-sdk-configuration), [log batch management](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/#batch-logrecord-processor), and setting [per signal overrides for endpoints](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter/#otel_exporter_otlp_traces_endpoint). 

Not all upstream options are supported&mdash;for example, the wasmCloud host does not support changing format to gRPC.

:::info[Note]
In cases where the system receives conflicting configurations for the same option via environment variable and command line argument, upstream OpenTelemetry libraries prioritize configurations set via environment variable. Refer to the [OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/sdk-configuration/) for more details.

Signal-specific options on the wasmCloud host are detailed on the [traces](/docs/deployment/observability/traces.mdx), [logs](/docs/deployment/observability/logs.mdx), and [metrics](/docs/deployment/observability/metrics.mdx) pages.
