The wasmCloud host supports recording and exporting distributed traces using the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (OTEL) specification. If you haven't worked with distributed traces before, [this primer](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/observability-primer/#distributed-traces) is a great place to start. 

Traces are essential for understanding the flow of messages through a distributed system. The wasmCloud host is instrumented to record traces for all control interface and RPC messages.

### Configuring Tracing

By default, tracing is disabled in the wasmCloud host. To enable traces, use the `--otel-traces-exporter` and `--otel-exporter-otlp-endpoint` [host config](/docs/reference/host-config) options. For example, refer to the `OTEL_` environment variables in this [Docker Compose file](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/examples/docker/docker-compose-full.yml) for a complete setup.

The example uses Grafana and Tempo, but wasmCloud works with any OTEL-compatible tracing backend, such as Zipkin, Jaeger, DataDog, Honeycomb, etc.
