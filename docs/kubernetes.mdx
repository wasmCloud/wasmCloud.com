wasmCloud can run standalone or on Kubernetes. The optional [`wasmcloud-operator`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-operator) utilizes the [**operator pattern**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/) and [**custom resource definitions (CRDs)**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/) to run wasmCloud hosts on Kubernetes&mdash;and thereby take full advantage of WebAssembly components in Kubernetes environments.

With a Kubernetes cluster running the wasmCloud operator, launching components as Kubernetes services can be as simple as running `kubectl apply` on a [wadm manifest](/docs/ecosystem/wadm/model.md): 

```shell
kubectl apply -f wadm.yaml
application/echo created
```

For instructions on how to deploy wasmCloud with Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes page in our Operator Guide](/docs/deployment/k8s/). You can also watch a [video of the quickstart on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/embed/239Q_hAKqPw?si=y0nHeFHfCPOdItNU&amp;start=235&amp;end=780):

## How we run WebAssembly on Kubernetes

wasmCloud hosts can run on a Kubernetes cluster or external to it. Regardless of where hosts are running, they can be connected on a [lattice](/docs/concepts/lattice). Kubernetes handles infrastructure management (the job for which it is designed) by orchestrating wasmCloud hosts, while wasmCloud handles application-level operations with full support for component capabilities.

This separation of concerns&mdash;Kubernetes for infrastructure, wasmCloud for applications&mdash;means that WebAssembly runtime operations are unconstrained by container-centric frameworks and abstractions; wasmCloud can extend Kubernetes to provide new hybrid compute options and expand the frontiers of computing.

* Avoid lock-in to proprietary systems
* Run on existing cloud native infrastructure 
* Leverage and build on the most powerful and singular features of the WebAssembly [component model](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/concepts/components), such as composability and interoperability

## Components and cloud native standards

wasmCloud is designed to conform to cloud native standards, making it simple to use existing tooling for everything from observability to policy to registries.

- **Open Policy Agent**: wasmCloud's [policy service API](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/deployment/security/policy-service) makes it easy to communicate with external policy servers using engines like [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/).
- **OpenTelemetry**: wasmCloud emits [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) signals for [traces, logs, and metrics](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/deployment/observability/observability-with-opentelemetry), compatible with your favorite observability tooling.
- **Backstage**: Develop Backstage plugins with any language using Cosmonic Labs' [`bigband` project](https://github.com/cosmonic-labs/backstage-bigband).
- **Argo CD**: Smoothly integrate Argo CD for GitOps flow using our [concordance-gitops](https://github.com/cosmonic/concordance-gitops) example.
- **Pull from OCI registries**: wasmCloud pulls Wasm components packaged as Open Container Initiative (OCI) images&mdash;so it's simple to store application components and providers in your existing private registries.
- **Open Application Model (OAM)**: wasmCloud manifests use the same Open Application Model specification as most Kubernetes extensions. If you've worked with K8s, you should be right at home.
