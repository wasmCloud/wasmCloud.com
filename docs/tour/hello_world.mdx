# Building An Echo Service

Build and run your first wasmCloud actor

<!--truncate-->

:::info

If you have not installed `wash`, follow the [installation guide](../installation/) first.

:::

In this guide, we'll be taking a tour through some of the most common activities in the wasmCloud
ecosystem like starting and configuring [actors](/docs/reference/glossary#actors) and
[capability providers](/docs/reference/glossary#capabilities). You'll get to build your own actors and providers in upcoming tutorials,
but for now let's get familiar with the runtime and tooling.

## Starting a host

To start a host, simply run `wash up`.

By default, `wash` will run the host in interactive mode. If you'd rather run the host in the background, run `wash up --detached` (or `wash up -d`, for short).

## Log files

If you encounter any problems, the host log files may contain useful error
messages, and it's good to know how to find them. The tabs below, organized by how you started the
wasmCloud host, show you where to find logs:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="wash-up" label="Wash Up" default>

By default, logs from `wash up` are automatically output to your terminal. If you ran the command
with the `--detached` flag, logs can be found in `~/.wash/downloads/wasmcloud.log`

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

Logs from hosts running in Docker, if started with our docker compose, can be found by running
`docker logs wasmcloud`

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" label="Manual">

If you manually installed the host from a downloaded release, look in `var/log/erlang.log.1`
relative to the folder where you extracted the release tar file.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Viewing the wasmCloud dashboard

Open a browser tab to the URL [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). This is the
wasmCloud dashboard (or _washboard_), a GUI that you will use quite often as you learn to build distributed applications in
this ecosystem.

<img src={washboard_init} width="800" alt="empty wasmCloud dashboard" />

:::info

By default, wasmCloud hosts connect to port **4000**. If this port isn't available, you won't see
the wasmCloud dashboard. If you need to change the port number, you can set the environment variable
`WASMCLOUD_DASHBOARD_PORT` to a new number before starting a host.

:::

## Querying hosts with `wash`

### Querying for running hosts

To see a list of running hosts, run the following command:

```shell
wash get hosts
```

You'll see output like this:

```shell
⢈⠩  Retrieving Hosts ...

  Host ID                                                    Uptime (seconds)
  NCPGH5CVPO3BAZ5OSQKXYHDKPBT3JXLG5EAOTG7XOXUWJ6AHZCFT57SI   711
```

### Querying a host's inventory

Now let's check the host's inventory. Using your host ID (not the one in this guide):

```shell
wash get inventory NCPGH5CVPO3BAZ5OSQKXYHDKPBT3JXLG5EAOTG7XOXUWJ6AHZCFT57SI
```

You'll see output similar to the following (your host ID will be different):

```shell
 Host Inventory (NCPGH5CVPO3BAZ5OSQKXYHDKPBT3JXLG5EAOTG7XOXUWJ6AHZCFT57SI)

  hostcore.os                           linux
  hostcore.osfamily                     unix
  hostcore.arch                         x86_64

  No actors found

  No providers found
```

The start of the output displays a host's labels. By default, this includes the operating system and
architecture the host is running on. These labels are prefixed by `hostcore`.

The rest of the inventory includes a list of **actors** and
**capability providers**. Since we haven't started any
actors or providers, these lists are empty.

The terminal output you've seen so far is also reflected in the dashboard. Throughout our guides and
tutorials, we may alternate between the wasmCloud dashboard UI and terminal-based CLI. When it comes
to managing a host's inventory, everything you can do in one view, you can do in the other.

### Running an actor

We'll return to the dashboard UI now. (If you're interested in doing this with `wash`, refer to
[this page](/docs/fundamentals/wash/)). From the dashboard, click the **Start Actor** button and choose
the _From Registry_ option. When prompted for an OCI reference URL, enter
`wasmcloud.azurecr.io/echo:0.3.8`. For now, choose **1** for the number of replicas:

<img src={washboard_start_actor} width="500" alt="Starting an actor modal" />

Click **Submit**, and after a few seconds, you should have a running actor on your host:

<img src={washboard_echo} width="500" alt="Running echo actor" />

### Running a capability provider

For this actor to receive HTTP requests, we need to start the HTTP Server capability provider.
Actors are signed WebAssembly modules, and as such they have embedded claims declaring their ability
to communicate with capability providers like the HTTP Server. Actors cannot communicate with any
capability provider for which they have not been signed.

Let's use `wash` to inspect the set of capabilities this actor has:

```shell
wash claims inspect wasmcloud.azurecr.io/echo:0.3.8
```

```shell
                               Echo - Module
  Account       ACOJJN6WUP4ODD75XEBKKTCCUJJCY5ZKQ56XVKYK4BEJWGVAOOQHZMCW
  Module        MBCFOPM6JW2APJLXJD3Z5O4CN7CPYJ2B4FTKLJUR5YR5MITIU7HD3WD5
  Expires                                                          never
  Can Be Used                                                immediately
  Version                                                      0.3.8 (4)
  Call Alias                                                   (Not set)
                               Capabilities
  HTTP Server
  Logging
                                   Tags
  None
```

To start the HTTP server capability provider, click **Start Provider** and then select _From
Registry_. Supply the OCI URL `wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.17.0` and leave the _link name_ set
to `default`. You should now see this capability provider running, and within 30 seconds it should
report its status as Healthy.

<img src={washboard_httpserver} width="600" alt="Running HTTP server" />

Let's return to `wash` now and re-query the host's inventory. Re-run the command `wash get inventory`.
You should see something like the following (again, your Host ID will be different):

```shell
Host Inventory (NCPGH5CVPO3BAZ5OSQKXYHDKPBT3JXLG5EAOTG7XOXUWJ6AHZCFT57SI)

  hostcore.osfamily                                                              unix
  hostcore.os                                                                    macos
  hostcore.arch                                                                  aarch64

  Actor ID                                                    Name               Image Reference
  MBCFOPM6JW2APJLXJD3Z5O4CN7CPYJ2B4FTKLJUR5YR5MITIU7HD3WD5    Echo               wasmcloud.azurecr.io/echo:0.3.8

  Provider ID                                                 Name               Link Name          Image Reference
  VAG3QITQQ2ODAOWB5TTQSDJ53XK3SHBEIFNK4AYJ5RKAX2UNSCAPHA5M    HTTP Server        default            wasmcloud.azurecr.io/httpserver:0.17.0
```

### Linking actors and capability providers

Since the HTTP server provider hasn't been _linked_ to any actor yet, it hasn't yet opened a port to listen to web
requests to forward to the actor. To allow the actor and provider to communicate, they need to be
linked.

Go back to the web UI and click **Define Link**. Select the actor and provider from the dropdown
boxes, as shown below. Leave the _Link Name_ as default, and set the _Contract ID_ to
`wasmcloud:httpserver`. For the _Values_ field, you'll need to provide an address including hostname
and port. Enter the following in the _Values_ field:

```shell
address=0.0.0.0:8080
```

<img src={washboard_link} width="500" alt="Link definition modal" />

Once you see that the link has been added to the dashboard, you are ready to send a request to your
actor.

### Interacting with your actor

In another terminal window, run the following command:

```shell
curl localhost:8080/echo
```

In response, you should receive your request object (notice the path argument):

```
{"body":[],"method":"GET","path":"/echo","query_string":""}
```

Feel free to try out different methods of making a request to your actor, including adding headers
or using a different HTTP method, to see different outputs.

Congratulations! You've made it through the first guide to wasmCloud. You should now feel
comfortable exploring the ecosystem, starting and stopping the host runtime, interacting with the
wasmCloud dashboard UI, and interacting with hosts using `wash`.

To learn more about actors, providers, and other topics, continue on to the **Fundamentals** section.
