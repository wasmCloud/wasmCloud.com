## Scaling up üìà

WebAssembly can be easily scaled due to its small size, portability, and [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/)'s ability to efficiently instantiate multiple instances of a single WebAssembly component. We leverage these aspects to make it simple to scale your applications with wasmCloud. Components only use resources when they're actively processing requests, so you can specify the number of replicas you want to run and wasmCloud will automatically scale up and down to meet demand. Let's scale up our hello world application to 100 replicas by editing `wadm.yaml`:

```yaml {15-17}
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  annotations:
    description: 'HTTP hello world demo using the WebAssembly Component Model and WebAssembly Interfaces Types (WIT)'
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/components/http-hello-world-rust:0.1.0
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            # Update the scale to 100
            replicas: 100
```

Now your hello application is ready to deploy v0.0.3 with 100 replicas, meaning it can handle up to 100 concurrent incoming HTTP requests. Just run `wash app deploy wadm.yaml` again, wasmCloud will be configured to automatically scale your component based on incoming load.

## Distribute Globally üåç

No matter where your components and capability providers run, they can seamlessly communicate on the [lattice](/docs/concepts/lattice). This means you can deploy your components to any cloud provider, edge location, or even on-premises and they will be able to communicate with each other. This is possible because wasmCloud uses [NATS](https://nats.io/) as its messaging layer, which is a lightweight, high-performance, and secure messaging system that can be deployed anywhere.

Distributing your application just requires updating your manifest to include spread information and making sure there are available wasmCloud hosts in the desired locations. We can update our hello application to run in multiple locations by editing `wadm.yaml`:

```yaml {17-27}
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  annotations:
    description: 'HTTP hello world demo using the WebAssembly Component Model and WebAssembly Interfaces Types (WIT)'
spec:
  components:
    - name: http-component
      type: component
      properties:
        image: ghcr.io/wasmcloud/components/http-hello-world-rust:0.1.0
      traits:
        - type: spreadscaler
          properties:
            replicas: 100
            # Ensure the component is spread across multiple zones
            # Of the 100 replicas, place 80% in us-east-1 and 20% in us-west-1
            spread:
              - name: eastcoast
                weight: 80
                requirements:
                  zone: us-east-1
              - name: westcoast
                weight: 20
                requirements:
                  zone: us-west-1
```

These requirements will ensure that 80% of the replicas are placed in `us-east-1` and 20% in `us-west-1`. You can specify any number of zones and weights to distribute your components across multiple locations. Each requirement matches directly with a [label](/docs/deployment/hosts/labels) that must be present on a host, and your currently launched host doesn't have any specified labels. Let's launch two more hosts with the required labels, and then deploy our new application.

:::info
If you already deployed your application, it will be placed in the `Failed` state because the requirements are not met. As soon as we launch the hosts with the required labels, the application will be automatically rescheduled.
:::

```bash
wash up --multi-local --label zone=us-east-1 -d
wash up --multi-local --label zone=us-west-1 -d
```

Just run `wash app deploy wadm.yaml` again, wasmCloud will be configured to automatically distribute your component across multiple locations based on the spread requirements. You can see all of your hosts and the components running on them by running `wash get inventory`.

## Summary

Now you've learned how to scale your applications with wasmCloud and distribute them across multiple locations. You can use this same approach to scale and distribute any wasmCloud application based on load and location requirements. Read on to the next page to learn more about the benefits of wasmCloud and how to continue to develop after this quickstart.
