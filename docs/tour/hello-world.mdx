# Quickstart

wasmCloud enables you to **build polyglot applications** out of reusable [WebAssembly (Wasm) components](/docs/concepts/components.mdx) and **run them everywhere**&mdash;across any cloud, Kubernetes, datacenter, or edge.

In this tutorial:

- We'll use the **wasmCloud Shell (`wash`) CLI** to build a simple "Hello world" HTTP server application from a **WebAssembly component**&mdash;written in the language of your choice.
- Along the way, we'll start a **developer loop** that automatically deploys our application to a local wasmCloud environment.

## Install `wash`

First, we need to install the latest version of `wash`.

On macOS, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install `wash`:

```shell
brew install wasmcloud/wasmcloud/wash
```

On Ubuntu and Debian Linux, you can use `apt` to install `wash`:

```shell
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/wasmcloud/core/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
```

```shell
sudo apt install wash
```

On Windows, you can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to install `wash`:

```shell
choco install wash
```

We support other package managers and the option to install from source. If you'd like to use a different installation method, see the [**Installation**](/docs/installation) page.

Verify that `wash` is installed by running:

```shell
wash --version
```

## Choose your language

wasmCloud supports building WebAssembly components from any language that supports the [WASI 0.2 target](/docs/concepts/interfaces#well-known-interfaces), including Go, Rust, TypeScript, and others.

`wash` depends on your local language toolchain for your language of choice.

- **Choose the language** you would like to use.
- **Install the toolchain** or verify that you have the correct versions.

<Tabs groupId="lang" queryString>
  <TabItem value="tinygo" label="Go">

**Install the Go toolchain**

Requirements:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) 1.23.0+
- [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/) =0.33.0:
- [`wasm-tools`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools#installation)

On macOS or Linux, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install the Go toolchain:

```shell
brew install go
```

```shell
brew tap-new tinygo/tap
brew extract --version 0.33.0 tinygo-org/tools/tinygo tinygo/tap
brew install tinygo/tap/tinygo@0.33.0
```

You will also need to [download the binary for the latest version of `wasm-tools` for your architecture](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools#installation) and add it to your PATH.

On Windows, you can use [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) to install the Go toolchain (as well as the [`binaryen`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) tool to compile components on Windows):

```shell
scoop install go
```

```shell
scoop install tinygo@0.33.0
```

```shell
scoop install binaryen
```

You will also need to [install the latest version of `wasm-tools`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools#installation) and add it to your PATH.

**Install the Rust toolchain**

Requirements:

- [The Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- The `wasm32-wasip2` target for Rust

On **macOS or Linux**, you can use the official install script to download `rustup`, which will automatically install the Rust toolchain:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Once you've installed the Rust toolchain, use `rustup` to add the `wasm32-wasip2` target:

```shell
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
```

On **Windows**, you can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to install `rustup`, and then use `rustup` to install the Windows toolchain:

```shell
choco install rustup.install
```

```shell
rustup toolchain install stable-msvc
```

Note: On Windows, you will also need Visual Studio's C++ tools.

Once you've installed Rust, use `rustup` to add the `wasm32-wasip2` target:

```shell
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
```

  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

**Install the TypeScript toolchain**

Requirements:

- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) v10.8+
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) v5.6+

On macOS or Linux, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install `npm` (and Node.js):

```shell
brew install node
```

On Windows, you can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) to install `npm` (and Node.js):

```shell
choco install nodejs
```

Once you've installed Node.js and `npm` on macOS, Linux, or Windows, you can use `npm` to install TypeScript:

```shell
npm install -g typescript
```

## Create a new component

Now that we've installed `wash` and our language toolchain, it's time to create a new component project.

<Tabs groupId="lang" queryString>
  <TabItem value="tinygo" label="Go">

In your terminal, run:

```shell
wash new component hello --template-name hello-world-tinygo
```

After a moment, `wash` will create a new directory called `hello` with all of the required project files for building a component from your chosen language.

Navigate to the `hello` project directory:

```sh
cd hello
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust">

In your terminal, run:

```shell
wash new component hello --template-name hello-world-rust
```

After a moment, `wash` will create a new directory called `hello` with all of the required project files for building a component from your chosen language.

Navigate to the `hello` project directory:

```sh
cd hello
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="TypeScript" label="TypeScript">

In your terminal, run:

```shell
wash new component hello --template-name hello-world-typescript

```

After a moment, `wash` will create a new directory called `hello` with all of the required project files for building a component from your chosen language.

Navigate to the `hello` project directory:

```sh
cd hello
```

Install the npm packages for your project:

```shell
npm install
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Start your developer loop

From our project directory, we'll run:

```shell
wash dev
```

The `wash dev` command automatically **builds your WebAssembly component** and **deploys it to a local wasmCloud environment**. This will take a moment, and the terminal output will update you on the process. The last step should look like this:

```text
âœ… Successfully started host, logs writing to /home/.wash/dev/kSKCGi/wasmcloud.log
ðŸš§ Building project...
...
âœ¨ HTTP Server: Access your application at http://127.0.0.1:8000
ðŸ‘€ Watching for file changes (press Ctrl+c to stop)...
```

By default, the application will run on our local port 8000. In a new terminal tab, we can `curl` our application:

```shell
curl localhost:8000
```

The application should return:

```text
Hello from <language>!
```

You just ran a WebAssembly application in wasmCloud!

## Make the application yours

Now we'll make a change to our code and see how the running application updates automatically.

<Tabs groupId="lang" queryString>
  <TabItem value="tinygo" label="Go">

**Modify `main.go`**

The Go code for our component is found in `hello/main.go`.

Open the file in your code editor and change the "Hello" message in the `handleRequest` function. You might modify the message to say hello from WebAssembly, your own name, or whatever else you like.

```go
// Send HTTP response
func handleRequest(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello from Go!\n") // [!code --]
  fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello from Wasm!\n") // [!code ++]
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="rust" label="Rust" default>

**Modify `lib.rs`**

The Rust code for our component is found in `hello/src/lib.rs`.

Open the file in your code editor and change the "Hello" message on line 19. You might modify the message to say hello from WebAssembly, your own name, or whatever else you like.

```rust
response_body
            .write()
            .unwrap()
            .blocking_write_and_flush(b"Hello from Rust!\n") // [!code --]
            .blocking_write_and_flush(b"Hello from Wasm!\n") // [!code ++]
            .unwrap();
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="typescript" label="TypeScript">

**Modify `http-hello-world.ts`**

The TypeScript code for our component is found in `hello/http-hello-world.ts`.

Open the file in your code editor and change the "Hello" message on line 23. You might modify the message to say hello from WebAssembly, your own name, or whatever else you like.

```typescript
// Write hello world to the response stream
outputStream.blockingWriteAndFlush(
  new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode('Hello from Typescript!\n')) // [!code --]
  new Uint8Array(new TextEncoder().encode('Hello from Wasm!\n')) // [!code ++]
);
```

  <TabItem value="unlisted" label="My Language Isn't Listed">

{' '}

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '100%' }}>
    <HubspotForm
      portalId="20760433"
      formId="71e74f55-cc30-41de-9d41-e3d9dc159c71"
      onSubmit={() => console.log('Submitted form')}
      onReady={(form) => console.log('Form ready for submit')}
      region="na1"
      loading={<div>Loading...</div>}
    />
  </div>
</div>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Save the modified file. The `wash dev` automatically builds and deploys the updated component.

In the terminal, `curl` the application again:

```shell
curl localhost:8000
```

```text
Hello from Wasm!
```

## Next steps

We installed `wash`, built our first component, and ran our application locally with `wash dev`.

In our next tutorial, we'll **add pluggable, reusable capabilities** like key-value storage to our application.
