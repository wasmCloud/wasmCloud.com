description: "wash down command reference"

This command will stop all the resources started by `wash up`. Primarily, it will stop the wasmCloud host and NATS leaf that were started on your local machine. If there is a single host running on your machine, `wash down` will stop that singular host. In case of multiple hosts, the user gets a choice to stop a specific host or all the running hosts on the system. To stop a specific host in a multiple host scenario, pass the `--host-id` flag to the command. To stop currently running hosts, pass the `--all` flag.

### Usage
```
# For a singular host
wash down 

# For a specific host
wash down --host-id=hostid

# For all hosts
wash down --all
```
