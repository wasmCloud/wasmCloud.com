### Creating your own context

If you'd like to use contexts to manage connections to multiple local lattices, you can create your own context. You can do that in one of two ways:

```bash
# Create a context with specified name and default values
wash ctx new ctx_tutorial
```

```bash
# Create a context interactively with terminal prompts
wash ctx new --interactive
```

Once created, you can use the `edit` subcommand to easily edit those contexts. `wash` attempts to use the terminal editor defined in your environment as `EDITOR`, but will also accept an argument for your favorite terminal editor.

```bash
wash ctx edit --editor vim ctx_tutorial
```

We specified a context above, but if you omit that argument then you'll be interactively prompted to select a context. You can go ahead and edit your context to change any connection parameters, or perhaps a cluster seed, and once you're finished editing you can save and quit your editor (hopefully we aren't locking you into vim here if this is your first time. `:wq` writes and quits.) After you're finished editing, use `wash ctx default` to change the default context to your new context, and `wash` will automatically use that context's values for your next control interface command or remote procedure call.
