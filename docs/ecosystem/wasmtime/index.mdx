# Wasmtime

## Overview

The wasmCloud host serves as a runtime environment and uses **Wasmtime** as the underlying WebAssembly (Wasm) runtime. The runtime implements the virtual instruction set architecture (ISA) targeted by Wasm binaries.

Wasmtime is an open source WebAssembly runtime [hosted by the Bytecode Alliance](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) and designed for use either as part of a larger stack or as a standalone runtime, running across a variety of operating systems and architectures. Wasmtime supports the WebAssembly standard as well as the [WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)](/docs/reference/glossary#webassembly-system-interface-wasi) and the [Component Model](/docs/reference/glossary#the-component-model).

In wasmCloud, Wasmtime provides a flexible production-grade runtime designed for [defense-in-depth security](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/security.html#defense-in-depth).

:::info[Compared to Kubernetes...]
Wasmtime serves a similar role to a container runtime such as containerd on a Kubernetes node, but don't put too much weight on the analogy: components are not containers, and using a dedicated WebAssembly runtime enables wider ecosystem reuse.

## Composition and the runtime

WebAssembly components can be **composed**, meaning that they can be combined into a single component. Inside the encapsulating component, the constituent components link imports and exports, fulfilling one another's dependencies and otherwise communicating in order to execute the functionality of the greater application. 

When you run a composed component on wasmCloud, the Wasmtime runtime in the host resolves the links between the encapsulated components. (This contrasts with **runtime linking** via wRPC, in which connections between components are mediated by the wRPC protocol and wasmCloud hosts.)

*Component foo and component bar were composed at build-time into a single component&mdash;when the composed component runs, Wasmtime resolves the links between components foo and bar.*

For more information, see [Linking Components](/docs/concepts/linking-components/) and [Linking at Build](/docs/concepts/linking-components/linking-at-build).

## Using Wasmtime for local development

In some cases, developers may wish to test components against standalone Wasmtime. 

To install on Linux or macOS run:

```shell
curl https://wasmtime.dev/install.sh -sSf | bash
```

Users on Windows and other operating systems can download Wasmtime from the GitHub repository's [Releases](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases) page.
