When deploying apps using [wadm](../ecosystem/wadm/index.md), the easiest way to manage these apps is using `wash app`. `wash app` provides us with all the tools needed to add, remove and get the necessary details of your deployed as well as undeployed applications. Following are the subcommands available under `wash app`.

- `list`
- `get`
- `history`
- `delete`
- `put`
- `deploy`
- `undeploy`

### `list`
This will retrieve a list of all applications that wadm knows about. Application specifications (also referred to in our documentation and code as "models") are stored in a model store and are associated to your lattice.

Usage: 

```
wash app list
```

### `get`
The `get` command is used to retrieve the details for a specific version of a model. You can retrieve both the original text (e.g. YAML) that you submitted and the vetted and normalized model in JSON format.

Usage:

```
wash app get <name> [version]
wash app get petclinic 0.0.1
wash app get petclinic 0.0.1 -o json
```

### `history`
The `history` command is used to retrieve the version history of a given model. You can view all the previous versions available in store and their respective status for a given app.

Usage:

```
wash app history <name>
wash app history petclinic
```

### `delete`
The `delete` command is used to delete an application model of a specific version. You can optionally delete _all_ versions of a specification as well.

Usage:

```
wash app delete <name> <version>
wash app delete petclinic 0.0.1
wash app delete petclinic --delete-all
```

### `put`

Performs an _idempotent_ put operation for an application specification _version_. Each time you put a model spec YAML to the server, it will either produce a new version or _be ignored_. Versions are _immutable_ and as such cannot be overwritten. If you wish to change anything about your spec, it needs to be done in a new version.

Usage:

```
wash app put <SOURCE>
wash app put petclinic.yaml
```

### `deploy`
When a version of an application specification is deployed, wadm will start monitoring the state of your lattice. Wadm will compare the desired state of an application with its current state and issue the appropriate commands to reconcile the state.

Usage:

```
wash app deploy <name> [version]
wash app deploy petclinic v0.0.1
```

### `undeploy`
Undeploying an application spec tells wadm to stop monitoring that deployment. By default, all resources originally provisioned for an application will be removed after that application is undeployed.

Usage:

```
wash app undeploy <name>
wash app undeploy petclinic
```
