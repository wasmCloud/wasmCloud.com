Even with all of wasmCloud's benefits, it still has every developers' least favorite file(s) - the config file. Luckily, we've cut it down to just one file and made it as simple as possible to use.

You can think of `wasmcloud.toml` as the `package.json` or `Cargo.toml` of the wasmCloud ecosystem. It's the main config file for any of your wasmCloud projects. Let's look at an example:

```toml
name = "echo"
language = "rust"
type = "actor"
version = "0.1.0"

[actor]
claims = ["wasmcloud:httpserver"]

[rust]
cargo_path = "/tmp/cargo"
```

This is a fairly minimal configuration for a wasmCloud Rust `echo` actor. It defines everything needed to build and sign the actor, such as which [capabilities the actor claims](https://wasmcloud.com/docs/fundamentals/capabilities/) and what language toolchain to use.

> Note that `cargo_path` isn't required. If you're using a standard `cargo` toolchain you could omit the `[rust]` section from this file entirely.

## `wash build`

The partner-in-crime to `wasmcloud.toml` is `wash build`. This command takes all the options set in the `wasmcloud.toml` file to build and sign the actor/provider/interface.

See the [`build` docs](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates/wash-cli#build) for more info.
