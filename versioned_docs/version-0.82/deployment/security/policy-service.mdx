wasmCloud hosts will always enforce a certain level of security by default that _cannot be loosened_. For example, hosts will always validate [invocations](/docs/deployment/security/zero-trust-invocations) and [runtime links](/docs/developer/debugging/actors#missing-runtime-links).

A _policy service_ can be used to restrict starting/communicating with untrusted actors and providers on particular hosts.

**The policy service is disabled by default**. When enabled, the policy service will be called by a host when:
- a particular actor or provider is started for the first time
- an invocation is received between two entities for the first time

The policy service evaluates the provided action and returns a response indicating whether it is permitted. This response is cached by the host, so subsequent requests for the same action will not incur any overhead.

### Policy Requests and Responses

Policy requests are made on a NATS subject, which is specified by the `--policy-topic` [host config](/docs/reference/host-config) option.

    },  
    "action": "[start_provider | start_actor | perform_invocation]"
}
```

```
{
    "requestId": "...",
    "permitted": true,
    "message": "..." (optional)
}
```
</details>

### Revoking Policy Decisions

Past policy decisions can be revoked/overridden by the policy service by publishing on the `--policy-changes-topic` NATS subject.

### Hosting a Policy Service

Since the policy service API is over NATS, it can be implemented by anything that can subscribe and publish responses to the configured policy topic (including a wasmCloud actor!).

An example policy service is available as a [wasmCloud actor](https://github.com/wasmCloud/examples/tree/main/actor/policy).
