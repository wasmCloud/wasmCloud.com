The wasmCloud host supports pulling images for [actor components](/docs/concepts/actors) and [capability providers](/docs/concepts/capabilities) from [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) (Open Container Initiative) registries.

### Configuring Access to a Private registry

In production environments, it's common to pull artifacts from a private registry. wasmCloud hosts can configured to authenticate with a private registry using [host configuration](/docs/reference/host-config).

### Working with Multiple Registries

Sometimes it's necessary to pull artifacts from multiple private registries. In this case, a [config service](/docs/deployment/hosts/config-service) can be used to provide supplemental configuration, including credentials for multiple OCI registries.
