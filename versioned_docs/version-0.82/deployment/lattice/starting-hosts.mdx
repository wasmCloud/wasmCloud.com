When a wasmCloud host starts with no additional parameters or configuration, it creates a new "lattice of one"; the host starts with an _ad hoc_ generated seed key and uses the corresponding public key for the issuers list, which means it will not be able to communicate with other hosts.

To ensure that any set of hosts are able to join the same lattice and securely communicate with each other, specify the following [host config](/docs/reference/host-config) options:

- All hosts must have the same `WASMCLOUD_LATTICE_PREFIX`
- All hosts must have the same comma-delimited list of `WASMCLOUD_CLUSTER_ISSUERS`
- Each host must have a single `WASMCLOUD_CLUSTER_SEED` that has a corresponding public key in the list of valid cluster issuers
- Each host must have NATS credentials that allow access to a shared NATS subject hierarchy for **RPC** - supplied by `WASMCLOUD_RPC_*` environment variables.
- Each host must have NATS credentials that allow access to a shared NATS subject hierarchy for **Control** - supplied by the `WASMCLOUD_CTL_*` environment variables.
