All wasmCloud hosts are segmented into distinct namespaces called [lattices](/docs/concepts/lattice).

When running locally with `wash up`, the lattice name defaults to `default`. In production, it's common to run multiple lattices on the same NATS cluster, where each lattice gets its own name. 

From a provisioning perspective, a lattice is little more than:
- a name(space)
- NATS [subject hierarchies](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/subjects) based off the namespace: (`wasmbus.ctl.{lattice-id}.>`, `wasmbus.rpc.{lattice-id}.>`, `wasmbus.evt.{lattice-id}.>`, etc.)
- lattice metadata, which is stored in JetStream as a `LATTICEDATA_{lattice-id}` [Key Value bucket](https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/developer/develop_jetstream/kv)
- lattice [cluster keys](/docs/deployment/security/zero-trust-invocations)
- one or more running hosts

The following guides explain how to create and manage each of these components.
