:::info

The primary wasmCloud host runtime is the [`wasmcloud-host`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates/host), which you'll be using if you're running the host from wash, a released binary, or with the [wasmcloud](https://hub.docker.com/r/wasmcloud/wasmcloud) docker image.

The Javascript host has different log messages, and it's recommended to create an issue in the [wasmcloud-js repo](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmcloud-js/issues/new) if you are running into errors in the browser.

:::

The first place to check when troubleshooting the host is logs. wasmCloud host logs include the following:

1. Logs from the host runtime
1. Logs from actors
1. Logs from capability providers

### Finding the Logs

<Tabs queryString="installation">
  <TabItem value="binary" label="wash" default>

If you followed the [installation](/docs/0.82/installation) guide, then you likely started the host by running `wash up`. By default, the logs will be printed to the screen, but if you ran the host using `--detached`, the logs will be written to `~/.wash/downloads/wasmcloud.log`.

At the start of this logfile you'll see something like:

```
2023-12-19T21:36:49.708714Z  INFO async_nats::options: event: connected
2023-12-19T21:36:49.708910Z  INFO async_nats::options: event: connected
2023-12-19T21:36:49.711351Z  INFO wasmcloud_host::wasmbus: bucket already exists. Skipping creation. bucket=LATTICEDATA_default
2023-12-19T21:36:49.712048Z  INFO wasmcloud_host::wasmbus: bucket already exists. Skipping creation. bucket=CONFIGDATA_default
2023-12-19T21:36:49.714279Z  INFO wasmcloud_host::wasmbus: wasmCloud host started host_id="NBNHZROISSPTB4U77L53USB47S5A7HWETPCVAENGYLTWHMKR2B7Q37VT"
```

Logs are appended to the end of this file as they are generated, so for the latest logs, you'll want to check the end of the file. On Unix systems, you can use the `tail` command to see the last several lines of the file, and you can use `tail -f` to stream new logs as they are written.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

If you ran the wasmCloud host inside a docker container, you can use the `docker logs` command to view the logs. To find the name of the wasmCloud host container, run:

```bash
docker ps -a --format "table {{.Image}}\t{{.Names}}"
```

You should see output like:

```
IMAGE                               NAMES
wasmcloud/wasmcloud:latest          docker-wasmcloud-1
```

Then you can view the logs by running:

```bash
docker logs -f docker-wasmcloud-1
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Changing the log level

To configure the log level, you can use the `--log-level` flag, or set the `WASMCLOUD_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable, when starting the host.

The wasmCloud host supports the following log levels:

- `error`
- `warn`
- `info` (default)
- `debug`
- `trace`

If you want to configure the log level for a specific library, you can set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable. For example, to change the log level of `async-nats` to `warn` while keeping the host at `debug`, you could run:

```bash
RUST_LOG=async_nats=warn,debug wasmcloud --log-level debug
```

:::info

Note that all actors and providers inherit the same log level settings as the host itself.

### Log Format

By default, the wasmCloud host emits logs as unstructured text. However, structured logs can be enabled via the `--enable-structured-logging` flag, or by setting the `WASMCLOUD_STRUCTURED_LOGGING_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`. Structured logs are convenient when forwarding logs to an aggregation tool.

Structured logs look like the following:

```
{"timestamp":"2023-12-19T22:16:06.389492Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"event: connected"},"target":"async_nats::options"}
{"timestamp":"2023-12-19T22:16:06.390689Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"event: connected"},"target":"async_nats::options"}
{"timestamp":"2023-12-19T22:16:06.401737Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"bucket already exists. Skipping creation.","bucket":"LATTICEDATA_default"},"target":"wasmcloud_host::wasmbus"}
{"timestamp":"2023-12-19T22:16:06.402034Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"bucket already exists. Skipping creation.","bucket":"CONFIGDATA_default"},"target":"wasmcloud_host::wasmbus"}
{"timestamp":"2023-12-19T22:16:06.406203Z","level":"INFO","fields":{"message":"wasmCloud host started","host_id":"NC3CUT4IP43REAEQDE33652YNK4Z7KFE7KI3XGUMHVNSP2TNY3CFAH4M"},"target":"wasmcloud_host::wasmbus"}
```
