There are two ways to test a capability provider.

The first method loads the provider into a test harness, and issues rpc calls to it to verify responses. This type of testing can be useful for "unit" tests - evaluating the provider in an isolated, controlled context. For examples of providers that use this kind of testing, look in the `tests` folder of [kvredis](https://github.com/wasmCloud/capability-providers/tree/main/kvredis) and [httpserver](https://github.com/wasmCloud/capability-providers/tree/main/httpserver-rs). These two capability providers exhibit different directions for rpc: kvredis, an example of a [`providerReceive`](/docs/hosts/abis/wasmbus/interfaces/traits#wasmbus) service, receives commands from actors, and httpserver, an example of an [`actorReceive`](/docs/hosts/abis/wasmbus/interfaces/traits#wasmbus) service, sends messages to actors.

A second method for testing a provider is to run it in a realistic environment, interacting with a real host and real actors. To set up the environment,

1. Start a new local OCI registry. You can download the [Docker Compose YAML file](https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/blob/main/examples/docker/docker-compose-full.yml) and run `docker compose up -d registry`. You'll also need to [allow unauthenticated OCI registry access](/docs/developer/workflow/#allowing-unauthenticated-oci-registry-access) before starting the wasmCloud host.

2. Upload the newly-created _provider archive_ to the local OCI registry (You can use `wash push ...`, or if you have one of the provider project Makefiles, `make push`) `make start` to start it.

Previous guides used `wash reg push`, which is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

3. Upload an actor that utilizes the provider to the local OCI registry (`wash build` from the actor source folder to compile it, sign it, and then use `wash reg push` to upload it to the registry). Then, use `wash start` to start the actor from the local registry.
4. Link the actor with `wash link` [on the command line](/docs/developer/actors/run#add-a-link-definition). For the fakepay provider, no extra configuration parameters values are required for the link command. Note that even if you don't supply configuration values, an actor must be linked to a provider, and be signed with sufficient claims, before it can communicate with the provider.

5. Invoke the actor by sending a JSON payload on the command line with `wash call actor -o json --data input.json`. The method name invoked, and the parameters in input.json must exactly match the interface implemented by your actor. In the previous section we used `CheckoutRequest` that might have a JSON body as follows:

   ```json
   {
     "payment_entity": "ab3428cj2q34kdas23j0123_123",
     "payment_token": "token1"
   }
   ```

6. Since the response will be serialized in _message pack_ format, the data may look a little awkward in the terminal output, but you'll be able to see your actor using your new provider in the output.
