:::warning[Changing in 1.0+]
The term "actor" is deprecated. wasmCloud 1.0 and later simply refer to this entity as a **component**, reflecting wasmCloud's standardization around WebAssembly components. You can learn more [here](/docs/concepts/components).
:::

To perform the steps in this guide, you'll need to have completed [installation](/docs/installation.mdx) of `wash`. You'll be able to pick your own language, or follow the "bring your own component" guide to develop an actor in any language that supports Wasm components. For a conceptual overview of actors, see the [actor concepts](/docs/0.82/concepts/actors) documentation.

The following pages will take you through the process of developing actors:

- [Create](./generate)
- [Build](./build)
- [Run](./run)
- [Iterate](./update)
- [Publish](./publish)
